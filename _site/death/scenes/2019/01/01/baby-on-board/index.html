  <p>Today’s prompt: “You have just swallowed your pride and done something you didn’t want to do. Your friend wants to know why. The two of you are driving around an almost-full parking garage looking for a space for the friend’s oversize pickup. Write the scene.”</p>

<p>“I thought you really liked Katie,” Tori says. “Wait is that – no, crap, there’s a Fiat there, couldn’t see past the bumper.”</p>

<p>“I do, but it’s just – she doesn’t want kids. I kept telling myself that it didn’t matter, that – Jesus Christ, why does everybody have to park on the fucking line – that it was fine to just be with someone fun, that I’ve got plenty of time, but I don’t have forever, y’know? But I’m definitely going to miss her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry things didn’t work out. You guys seemed like you were good together, but I totally understand on the kids issue. You’re right – you have to do what’s right for yourself. Holy fucksticks, it’s like the whole town is parked here. Yeah, though, you can’t just put off things that are important to you. Life’s too short.”</p>

<p>You’re turning the corner to head up yet another ramp when a black Hummer going way too fast for a parking garage slams into your friend’s Toyota Tundra, plowing it into a row of parked cars. You have just enough time to register a few details before you black out: the broken glass and crumpled pickup cab from where you were T-boned; the blood seeping from your forehead; and, on the back of the Hummer that has forced its way past you, a “Baby on Board” sign next to vinyl decals of a bat-winged demon, a woman, and a tiny demon.</p>
