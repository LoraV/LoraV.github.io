Today's prompt: "Write the copy for a cereal box so that someone would actually want to buy this exciting new flavor."

Cthuhu-Os has a flavor to kill for! Cultists love it, the Old Ones crave it! A single serving of Cthuhu-Os gives you all the energy you need to start the day with murder and mayhem! Cthuhu gives it two tentacles up! 

Cthuhu-Os! Wash it down with the blood of the innocent!
