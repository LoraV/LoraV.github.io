Today's prompt: "A four-year-old child is afraid of the dark. Write about the child's fears and what you might say or do to help the child overcome the fears."

"Don't worry, Savannah," you tell the 4-year-old girl with the blanket pulled over her head. "Sure, they call Lexur'iga-serr'roth 'He Who Devours All in the Dark.' But I'm sure that nickname is just an exaggeration. I bet when he's done eating me he won't be hungry for you at all."
