Today's prompt: "Sitting in a single location for 20 minutes, take notes focusing exclusively on the sounds you can hear."

You know, I've been sitting in your mausoleum for the last 20 minutes and I can't hear anything at all other than the hum of nearby traffic. Either you didn't have any unfinished business, or ghosts are totally overrated.
