Today's prompt: "What nobody ever said to you"

The whole thing felt like it was straight out of "And Then There Were None." Guests who didn't know each other were invited out to a remote lodge. The bridge to town was destroyed after the last person arrived. And each of the guests were murdered, one after one, with different methods each time.

You had the misfortune of being caught discovering two of the bodies, Bree Summers, who you found dead face-first in the koi pond, and Elle Watson, who you discovered in a bathtub full of water and her blood. Things looked bad for you. The others shot you to prevent further murders. 

Of course, it wasn't you, as they discovered after that when the murders kept happening. But nobody ever said, "I'm sorry."
