Today's prompt: "Irresistible temptation"

The decadent-looking, poison-laced slice of chocolate cake.

The cliff's edge, imbued with adrenaline.

The cultists' library, shelf upon shelf of occult knowledge opened before you, blinding you to the guard approaching you with a dagger.

The booby-trapped vault of treasure gleaming in the setting sun.

The attractive Dream Witch Yidhra, devouring you to learn how to take on your appearance.

The Nancy Reagans of the world were wrong. Even the anti-drugs will kill you.
