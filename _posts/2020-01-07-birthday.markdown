Today's prompt: "Your best birthday"

Your best birthday was when you turned 9. Your parent got you a Gameboy, and you got to go to Chuck E. Cheese. You played tons of skee ball, ate pizza, and high fived the guy in the mouse costume.

Your worst birthday was when you were out with your friends at your favorite bar when a guy in a Chuck E. Cheese costume staggered through the door brandishing a chef's knife, which he plunged into your stomach.
