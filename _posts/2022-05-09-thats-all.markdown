This blog was started with a very specific project in mind: to turn every last writing prompt in the book _642 Things To Write About_ into a death scene. As of Friday, May 6, 2022, that project is complete.

That doesn't mean Yuh Dead is dead. I have ideas for what to do next with it. But I also have some other creative projects that I want to finish, so Yuh Dead will be going on indefinite hiatus while I get those projects either done or far enough under way that they won't be jeopardized if I pick this up again.

Prior to receiving the book of writing prompts, I wrote 30 Lovecraftian death scenes that my friends and I used during game nights when we played a Cthulhu-themed Werewolf-style game where most players' characters get killed off, sometimes more than once per game. They were published once as a 'zine, and before I go on hiatus, I'll be republishing them here. Just a little something to tide you over.
