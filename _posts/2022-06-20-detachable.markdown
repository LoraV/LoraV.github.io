When you spend a fair amount of time on the Wikipedia page for Cthulhu mythos deities, funny little things start to stand out, like the fact that at least two of them have detachable body parts. Yibb-Tstll has detached eyes in addition to her bat wings, and Ayi'ig is a cephalopod-esque horror whose tentacles can detach and operate on their own (and who apparently lives in Texas, because why not?). I'm not sure what the deal with that is. Who knows, maybe the creator was staring at a Mr. Potato Head. However, this might go some way toward explaining why your former companions decided to chop you up into your constituent parts and leave you strewn about like an unfinished game of Cootie.
