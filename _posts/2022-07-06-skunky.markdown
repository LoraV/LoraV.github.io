A plume of skunky smoke wafts across your face. 

“Oh, man, pass the Tastykakes*,” one of your attackers says.

You're tied up, awaiting your death. Until then, unfortunately, your attackers have ignored your requests to [please share/please not blow the devil's weed in your direction (delete as appropriate)].

“Dude,” another of your attackers says. “What if you like. Had a beekeeper suit? But instead of keeping the bees out? It kept the bees in.”

So yes. That's how you die. Poisoned by beestings inside a reverse beekeeper suit. But hey. At least you died with a contact high.

*Tastykakes, with two k's, were the 1914 predecessor to Hostess cupcakes.
