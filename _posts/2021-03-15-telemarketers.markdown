Today's prompt: "Write a script to give telemarketers to sell plastic pooper-scoopers."

Hello sir or madam,

Have you considered buying a pooper scooper? They make it that much less likely that you will die from untreated encephalitis caused by toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals, like some people named [insert-your-name-here] that I used to know.
