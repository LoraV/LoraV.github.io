Today's prompt: "A road trip with your sister"

It started as an ordinary road trip to visit some friends in the town where you grew up. You and your sister packed snacks, bottled water and plenty of audiobooks, but there was never any question of who would do the driving. Your sister is an incredible driver, and it's only because of her that you made it as far as you did. 

She made it through the freak snowstorm with nary a skid. When the semi truck carrying a manufactured home jackknifed in front of her in the middle of the highway, she managed to maneuver into the ditch alongside the highway and back out on the other side. She gunned it up the ramp away from the crowd of screaming, hatchet-wielding cannibals and over the deep canal to the other side. But when a plane full of livestock accidentally dropped an entire herd of cattle over the roadway, even she couldn't prevent a fatal collision with a cow.
