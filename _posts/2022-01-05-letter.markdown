Today's prompt: "The most painful letter you've ever had to write"

The cultists told you you could write a goodbye letter to your loved ones, as long as you wrote it in your own blood. They gave you a knife and a blank piece of paper. No pens, no quills. Just jab your finger and try to form the bloody driblets into letter shapes.

You wrote a letter to your son. You told him you loved him. You told him you missed him. You told him to warn the world -- murderous cultists are kidnapping innocent people and using them as sacrifices to raise their eldritch gods. You pricked your fingers over and over, squeezed out the blood a tiny bit at a time. You poured your very veins into that letter.

And then those fuckers didn't even mail it!
