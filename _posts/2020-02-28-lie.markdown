Today's prompt: "The thirty-year lie"

You spent the last three decades translating ancient scrolls, gathering mystic ingredients, and studying inscrutable and arcane rituals. And today, you and your comrades are gathered by the shore, chanting, as a mass breaks the surface. 

The mass stands on enormous, muscular, scaly hind legs. Wings unfurl from its back, and tentacles stretch out from its face. 

You turn to the man on your right. "Goddamit, Rick," you say. "You told me we were raising Atlantis."
