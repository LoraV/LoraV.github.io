Today's prompt: "Write a letter to your landlord."

To whom it may concern,

My name is Madge and I live in apartment 6 of your building at [ADDRESS REDACTED]. The last few days, I've noticed several beetles in my apartment. Could you please call an exterminator and get it taken care of?

Also, I've started to notice a really bad odor coming from somewhere. I don't think it's mildew this time. I asked Mrs. Nilsson if she was cooking something weird, but she denied it. Maybe you could look into it?


Sincerely,   
Madge Searles

To whom it may concern,

I live in apartment 6 of the rental building at [ADDRESS REDACTED]. I wrote to you a few days ago about the beetles in my apartment. You still haven't sent an exterminator. The beetles are getting much worse -- there are a lot more of them. They seem to be gathering along the wall of the living room near the wall I share with apartment 5. Please send an exterminator soon. There are so many of them, and they give me the heebie-jeebies.

The smell has gotten worse as well. It's almost like something died. Please send someone to figure out where it's coming from.

Sincerely,  
Madge Searles

To whom it may concern,

Madge from apartment 6 at [ADDRESS REDACTED] again. I looked up the beetles I wrote to you about. I think they're carrion beetles. Maybe something really did die. Please send someone round immediately. 

Sincerely,

To whom it may concern,

Madge. Apartment 6. [ADDRESS REDACTED]. Since you still haven't sent anyone to deal with the beetles, I pried up the floorboards where they had been congregating. Guess what? There's a body there, buried face down. I have notified the police. I also fished the wallet out of their [pants pocket/purse] with my kitchen tongs. It's someone named [insert your name here]. I don't know how they got here -- if the previous tenant left them, or if a maintenance person left them under the floorboards while I was out. Either way, you either failed inspect the unit properly after the last tenant left, or failed to vet your personnel properly. I expect my rent to be refunded.

Sincerely,  
Madge Searles
