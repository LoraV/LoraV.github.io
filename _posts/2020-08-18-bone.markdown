Today's prompt: "Finding a bone in a parking lot"

Molly stifled a scream as her pit bull mix, Roger, trotted from around the Subaru Forester at the back of the parking lot, carrying your ulna and radius in his mouth, the bones of your index and middle fingers dangling. 

Molly tried to call the police, but the cell service at the trailhead made it impossible to get through.

Peering around the SUV, Molly could see that few of the bones in your skeletal remains were intact. Most had been crushed beneath rocks. It didn't take long for the amateur detective to determine that this was no accidental rockslide, but rather that you were killed by assailants who repeatedly beat you with stones. But who would do a thing like that?

Molly stood tall and sniffed. There was something eldritch in the air. She followed the scent to a stand of trees near the trailhead. It was a bottle of Eau d' Lovecraft.

Cultists, Molly thought. It's always cultists.
