Today's prompt: "What you think about that always brings you to tears"

You approach the crying woman. "Are you okay? Can I do anything to help?"

"Y-y-y-you ca-aa-aan be a sna-aa-aa-ack," the woman says, still sobbing as she begins her transformation into the spiderlike demon goblin Jorogumo. 

Jorogumo still sobs as she nibbles your toes like popcorn, and wails as she picks her chelicerae with the bone of your little finger. She long ago learned that she catches more victims as a crying woman, and she can easily make herself cry by remembering the episode of SpongeBob Squarepants where SpongeBob loses his pet snail, Gary. But turning off the waterworks is a harder thing.
