Today's prompt: "If your brother knew you'd said that about him, he'd flay you alive. What did you say?"

"Only complete half-wits like my brother, who believe themselves well-versed in the art of torture and death but are not, would begin flaying someone at the shoulders and torso instead of the thighs or buttocks," you said.

Of course, he heard, and you were, for one last time, subjected to his incompetence.
