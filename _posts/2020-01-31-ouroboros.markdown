Today's prompt: "Keep a list of words you like, for their sound, for their meaning, or just for their goofy spelling. Pick one of those words and use it in a paragraph."

I'll never understand your compulsion for autocannibalism. Did it start with a spiral of self-loathing, or did your tail just look extra tasty one day? Whatever the cause, little snake, I, the narrator of your self-imposed death by devouring, am here to tell you that you have died of being an ouroboros.
