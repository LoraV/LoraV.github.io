I know the specter of death can be terrifying. Belief in an afterlife, while solace for some, ultimately relies on the believer's particular faith being true. You could double down on the Judeo-Christian version of things, but if the ancient Egyptians were right and you haven't been memorizing all the passphrases in the Book of the Dead, you're going to be eaten by the demon Ammit. But isn't it ultimately comforting to know that your struggle to delude yourself with invented meaning in a meaningless existence is finally at an end?

This has been Nihilism Corner.
