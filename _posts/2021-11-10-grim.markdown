Today's prompt: "You are the Grim Reaper. Write three different opening paragraphs for your autobiography, trying out very different styles."

You think I've got the spare time to write an autobiography, let alone three different versions? As if. Have you seen my to-do list lately? I've got to get Mabel Fitzroy right now, and then I have to cram in Julian Ortiz, Andrei Vasiliev and Margaret Chung in the second after that. And then I get a whole two-second break before I have to retrieve Liu Zihan, Ng Kwan and [insert-your-name-here], and then Zawadi Abdi, Seamus O'Hanrahan, Ajay Kapoor and Antonia Sousa. And that's just the next six seconds. Gotta go. Places to be, people to reap.
