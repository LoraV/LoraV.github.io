Today's prompt: "What can happen in a second"

The slash of a knife. A blow to the head. Your last gasp. The plunge into midair as the gallows trapdoor opens beneath you. A bullet ripping through your torso. A final shiver down your spine. A snap of monstrous jaws.

Death comes for us all, relentlessly, tick by tick by tick of the clock. I don't know how you'll die, whether your whole death encompasses a single second, or your last moment comes after long months of building agony. But I have a feeling, based on the cabal of people after your hide, that your last second will be memorable.
