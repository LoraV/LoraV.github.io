Today's prompt: "What a character holding a blue object is thinking right now"

The old woman with the blue orb is thinking about what you had for dinner last night. She closes her eyes as the taste floods her mouth. The texture of each bite, the smell -- she's experiencing every last bit of it.

The old woman with the blue orb is thinking about the last time you were in a hospital room, pacing the halls, staring out the windows, waiting anxiously for news.

A few stray black hairs nestle in the woman's white coiffure.

She's thinking about what you looked like when you danced at a friend's wedding.

She's thinking about your first taste of coffee, hot and bitter.

She's thinking about your first date, uncomfortable clothes and nerves.

The skin smooths at the corners of her eyes.

She thinks about your swimming lessons. A day at your first job, dealing with a difficult customer. Your first kiss.

The woman with the blue orb is thinking about a day you stood on the side of the road with a flat tire. A day you skinned your knee on the playground. A day you knicked yourself with a razor.

The young woman with the blue orb watches as you collapse in front of her on the floor of the cave. She smiles.
