"End of Pandemic? No COVID Deaths Reported Yesterday; Hospitalizations Down Again"     
"Robot Uprising Averted: Computer Scientists Discover Bug in Skynet Just In Time"   
"Conflicts in Myanmar, Afghanistan, Yemen, Tigray Cease: War Deaths Hit Zero in Unprecedented Simultaneous Peace Agreements"   
"Comet Just Misses Earth: 'That Was a Close One,' Scientist Says"   
"No More Mass Shootings: Gun Owners Throw Weapons Into the Sea as Manufacturers Cease Production"   
"Cthulhu Lies Dreaming: Elder God Rises, Is Tranquilized Before Causing Damage"   
"January Police Shootings Drop to Zero as Cities Embrace Alternatives: Crime Rates Fall; Police Unions Express Bafflement"   
"Zombie Outbreak Harmless After All: 'Turns Out They Like Ice Cream, Not Brains,' Scientist Says"   
"'Miracle Cure' Found for Cancer: Pharmaceutical Company Insists on Keeping Drug Affordable"   
"Tourist Unharmed In Freak Accident at The Met: [Insert your name here] Nearly Impaled By Lance in Arms and Armor Department"   

Look, clearly they're all wishful thinking, but I'm sitting here in this pandemic-slash-zombie apocalypse hiding from robots and Cthulhu. A girl can dream, can't she?

Oh, yeah, sorry about that accident with the suit of armor, but this is why they tell you not to touch things.
