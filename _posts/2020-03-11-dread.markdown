Today's prompt: "You wake up with a nameless feeling of dread in your gut, but you can't figure out what it is. Write down everything that could possibly happen during the day that could be something for you to dread."

Being devoured by Abholos, the Devourer in the Mist.  
Being fed on by Chaugnar Faugn, the Feeder.  
Being eaten by Gog-Hoor, Eater of the Insane, after accidentally reading _The King in Yellow._  
Being swallowed up by Kaalut, the Ravenous One.  
Being devoured by Lexur'iga-serr'roth, He Who Devours All in the Dark.  
Being devoured by M'Nagalah, the Devourer.  
Being devoured by Sheb-Teth, Devourer of Souls.  
Being devoured by Shuy-Nihl, the Devourer in the Earth.  
Being consumed by Xinlurgash, the Ever-Consuming.  
Being consumed by Yug-Siturath, the All-Consuming Fog.  
Being feasted on by Zvilpogghua, Feaster from the Stars.  

Of course, you only have to worry about one of these. To the Great Old Ones, you're only snack size.
