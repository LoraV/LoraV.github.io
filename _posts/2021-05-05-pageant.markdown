Today's prompt: "You're in the interview stage of the Miss America pageant. Besides your desire for world peace, what will you tell the judges?"

"Miss Arizona, the Old Ones have recently appeared on Earth, destroying whole cities and causing mass casualties. What can Americans do to counter this looming threat? You have 20 seconds."[^1]

"Well," you respond in your stunning midnight blue evening gown, "appeasement is out of the question since the Old Ones have an insatiable hunger for human flesh, and we have no leverage over them since they are impervious to our weaponry. It doesn't help that many Americans, including several contestants in this pageant who I saw chanting backstage, are serving them to obtain power, which is misguided since the Old Ones eat cultists and civilians alike. I fear there's little we can do, since this building trembles at their approach. Also, I find the fact that I have to answer this after being judged in my swimwear demeaning."

[^1]: What, you don't think a question like this would be fair game at a Miss America pageant, that it's all about young women vaguely wishing for world peace? [Not so much.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDPCmmZifE8) And by the way, it's still a great idea to donate to the [Society for Women Engineers.](https://swe.org/)
