Today's prompt: Make a scene with a character exhibiting really bad behavior.

Good lord, almost all these scenes involve a character murdering someone, and now I'm expected to up the ante? <Sigh/> Okay.

You get stabbed by a guy who is simultaneously inappropriately touching a female passerby, shouting slurs about Latinx individuals and transpeople, and littering.
