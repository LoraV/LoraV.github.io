Today's prompt: "A child is doing homework with an adult. Who are they? Reveal their relationship through their interaction about the schoolwork."

"Olive, what are you doing?"

"Cultist homework."

"Yeah, but what?"

"It's a ritual sacrifice."

"Honey, who taught you how to do that?"

"I'm doing it just like they show in the textbook."

"Oh, these newfangled textbooks, it's like new math all over again." The man picks up the textbook and stares at the pages. "Okay, I can see how that diagram is confusing. Look, Olive, let me help you with something real quick. It's going to be much easier if you hold the knife like this." He adjusts the girl's grip on the hilt, and re-angles the blade along your throat.

"Rrrrrrgh," you say through the gag.

"It feels weird holding it that way, Dad," Olive says.

"Trust me, Olive, you're going to have much more control if you hold it like this. You'll find it's much easier to cut through muscle that way. Now why don't you give it a go."
