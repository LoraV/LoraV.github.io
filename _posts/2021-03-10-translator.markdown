Today's prompt: "A translator doesn't want to translate what she's just been told." [As always, please disregard the pronoun in the prompt if you identify as male or nonbinary.]

You would think that ASL for "Cthulhu" would involve waggling your fingers below your chin like a tentacle beard. But it's not. True to form, the ASL for "Cthulhu" requires you to dislocate a minimum of three fingers to sign it properly. It is incredibly painful to execute, and when you must translate to hard-of-hearing attendees the warning, "Run! Cthulhu is attacking!", you are unable to suppress a yowl of pain that the Great Old One immediately homes in on.
