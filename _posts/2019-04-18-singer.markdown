Today's prompt: "You get to be any singer you choose and sing one song in a live concert."

You are opera singer Frederick Federici, performing as Mephistopheles in Gounod's *Faust.* You've just finished the finale, and are descending dramatically into the trapdoor in the stage, a dark devil falling from grace, when the heart attack comes.

No? Not an opera fan?

You are Wallace Hartley, a violinist and the leader of your band. You and your band members were hired to play aboard a fabulous new ship, the RMS Titanic. When it hit an iceberg, you led the band in a production meant to calm the crew as they worked to save as many passengers as could be fit onto the inadequate number of lifeboats. You finish with "Nearer, My God, to Thee," and call to your bandmates, "Gentlemen, I bid you farewell," as the waves drag you under.

You're more of a metalhead?

You are "Dimebag Darrell" Abbott, formerly of Pantera. You're now the guitarist for Damageplan, and you've gone on from your glam metal roots to pioneer a new genre of music, groove metal. You're performing in Columbus on your Devastation Across the Nation tour when a fan rushes the stage and shoots you with a Beretta. You are buried in a Kiss Kasket.

Sorry. Those are your options.
