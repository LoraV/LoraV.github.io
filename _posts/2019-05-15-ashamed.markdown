Today's prompt: "The one thing you're most ashamed of"

When the choice came down to "your life or hers," you chose yours. 

You tried to fool yourself in those few seconds. You told yourself you had a better chance than she did of overpowering the members of the Black Brotherhood, that sacrificing her life meant saving billions of others.

You were lying to yourself, of course. You were just afraid, and you didn't want to die.

Your choice had no consequence whatsoever, of course. They killed you both. They were always going to kill you both. But at least you wouldn't have looked like such a selfish jerk if you told them to save her.
