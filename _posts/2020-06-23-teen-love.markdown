Today's prompt: "You are a thirteen-year-old. Write a love letter to your boyfriend."

Dear Keith,

I can't believe we've been dating for a whole month! <3 <3 <3 Every day, I look forward to seeing you by my locker and hanging out between periods. U.S. History is so much better because you're in class with me. You are my sparkly vampire and my hunky werewolf all rolled into one. I feel so lucky you're my boyfriend.

Tonight do you want to drive up to Lookout Point where all those other teens have been getting murdered and make out?

Love you,

[Insert-your-name-here]
