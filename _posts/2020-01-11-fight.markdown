Today's prompt: "List the ways in which you fight life." [I decided to make a small tweak to the prompt for the purposes of my story.]

Most people think Death's game of choice is chess. Possibly they're familiar with the painting by TÃ¤by Church; more likely they've seen some reference to Ingmar Bergman's _The Seventh Seal_. So when Death came for you, and you challenged the embodiment of mortality to a game for your life, you were surprised when Death agreed to a boxing match. 

For a dude who's basically a skeleton in a robe, he packs quite a wallop. It wasn't even a good match; you went down in the first round. And you never got up again.
