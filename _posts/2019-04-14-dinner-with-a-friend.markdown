Today's prompt: "Go out to dinner with a friend, and as soon as you get home, write in that person's voice. Begin with something the person said." [I'm just writing a story that begins with a sentence someone said at a friend gathering last night.]

"This tastes like wet dog," you say.

Your friends laugh uproariously and pass another glass to you. You sip delicately, trying to catch the predominant note.

"This tastes like fresh asphalt," you say.

Your friends laugh again and pass you another glass.

"This tastes like a migraine," you say, making your way down the long line of tasters.

"This tastes like ass."

"This tastes like the dumpster behind a Taco Bell."

"This tastes like impending death."

"Impending death?" one of your friends asks.

You sip again. "Less impending now."

You sip one more time. You die.
