Today's prompt: "Find a [section of your writing](https://yuhdead.com/death/scenes/2019/04/24/bad-character/) that has no energy to it and rewrite it as one long sentence. Be sure that the sentence keeps expanding outward, don't worry about it being a run-on, and just let it flow." 

You wake up at 6 a.m., all smiles and eager to start your day, having gone to bed early last night after watching a few educational videos about personal hygiene, and after toweling off from your shower, you put on your favorite pants -- those khakis with the front pleats -- and your favorite light gray polo shirt, buttoned all the way up to the top, and then you make your lunch, slathering mayonnaise on two slices of Wonder Bread and topping them with two Kraft Singles -- ahh, processed American cheese, the perfect sandwich -- and you drop it into a brown bag with a Red Delicious, and now it's on to breakfast, decaf coffee and a bowl of plain oatmeal, so you stir your oatmeal, scoop out a big spoonful, and suddenly pitch forward, face down, dead, into the bowl, and wouldn't you know it, I was just too busy feigning excitement while stifling yawns to get your cause of death.
