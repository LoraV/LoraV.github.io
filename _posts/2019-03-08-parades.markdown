Today's prompt: "Parades"

The papier-mâché head of Cthulhu wends its way through the streets, its giant tentacles mechanically raising and lowering. The marching band follows, playing an instrumental version of "Cthulhu Fhtagn." Mascot versions of Yog-Sothoth, Shub-Niggurath and Nyarlathotep throw tentacle and eyeball-shaped candies to the crowd. And after that, rows upon rows of men and women march in perfect formation, holding pikes with heads. Yours is in the fifth row back, third from the right.
