Today's prompt: "You are Frankenstein. Write a letter to Mary Shelley thanking her for making your story known."

Dear Ms. Shelley,

I appreciate your interest in telling my story. I hope it will serve as a warning to all mankind against the temptations of playing God, that in attempting to understand and replicate the inner workings of life and existence, we may find ourselves perpetrating horrors. I have lost everything -- my brother, my childhood friend, and my love. No creature could be more miserable than I, and I have none to blame but myself and my own actions.

Enclosed, please find my diaries. They may aid you in the telling of my story. I have entrusted them and this letter to the care of Captain Walton. He may be able to fill you in on any events that may transpire after this last writing.

I must be off. Walton's crew will not accompany me or take me further, claiming that the ice makes the journey too dangerous. We have already been trapped in the ice once, so I suppose I cannot blame them, but I cannot allow my creation to escape justice, nor can I leave my dear Elizabeth unavenged. Though its antipathy clearly lies with me, my creature is a danger to mankind, and I cannot in good conscience allow it to escape. 

Walton assures me that by going on on foot across the ice, I have almost certainly signed my death warrant -- that I will freeze to death. I am sure he is right, but if I can destroy my hideous creation, it will have all been worth it. 

Thank you, Ms. Shelley. I wish you all the best in your writing endeavors. I would ask you to turn a sympathetic eye toward me in your book, but given what I am responsible for, perhaps it is best if you do not. 

Sincerely,

Victor Frankenstein
