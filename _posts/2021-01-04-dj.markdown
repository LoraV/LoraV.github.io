Today's prompt: "You are a radio disc jockey who has been handed a news alert about an explosion downtown. People are to evacuate the area. What do you say or do on air as further information does (or does not) come into the station?" (To the tune of "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life" by Indeep.)

Last night a DJ saved my life   
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah    
'Cause I was sittin' there facin' death   
And in just one breath you said   

You gotta get up   
You gotta get on   
You gotta get out girl   

A bomb was planted in my region   
And when it blew, it took your station   
But you warned me of the threat    
Out I get    

I didn't even pack a bag   
And if it wasn't for the DJ   
I don't know what I'd do, yeah   

Last night a DJ saved my life    
Last night a DJ saved my life from an explosion    
Last night a DJ saved my life   
Last night a DJ saved my life with a warning   

You know I hopped into my car   
The DJ didn't get that far, no  
Because you finished up the news   
At the end of the fuse   

There were bombs planted around   
All around this town    
You were trapped in the studio   
But you told me to go   
I might have lost my head   
But "Evacuate," you said.   
Check out my evacuation plan.   

Last night a DJ saved my life   
Last night a DJ saved my life, whoo-eee!  
Last night a DJ saved my life  
Last night a DJ kept me from going kablooey   

Last night a DJ saved my life   
Though they got stuck inside the station halls   
Last night a DJ saved my life   
Though they were crushed under the crumbling walls    

Hey listen up to your local DJ  
You better hear what they've got to say   

Someone has just made a bomb threat  
And now you start to break a sweat   
You tell your listeners to disperse  
So they don't end in a hearse   
Before all of this shit goes down    
You tell them to get out of town   
Yeah you tell them to get out of town   

Last night a DJ saved my life   

Someone has just made a bomb threat   
And now you start to break a sweat   
And now you start to break a sweat, break a sweat, break a sweat
