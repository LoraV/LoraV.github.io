Today's prompt: "What ten questions are you going to ask to figure out the object in a game of I Spy?"

Is it bigger than a breadbox?   
Is it alive?   
Is it a mammal?   
A reptile?   
What do you mean, sort of?   
Is it bigger than a refrigerator?   
Is it bigger than a house?   
Does it have tentacles?   
Is it giving off a distinct, nearly tangible aura of evil and menace?   
Is it coming right at me?
