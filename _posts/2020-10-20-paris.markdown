Today's prompt: "That day in Paris"

Kaiju crush the sidewalk cafes. King Ghidora destroys the Louvre. Guiron's ridiculous knife-shaped face wreaks havoc on the Arc de Triomphe. The Champs-Élysées is ripped apart by Barugon's deadly rainbow powers. Godzilla tramples through the Palace at Versailles. And Mothra topples the Eiffel Tower, where you had been taking pictures, killing you and all the other tourists. 

Dammit. This is exactly why you didn't go to Tokyo.
