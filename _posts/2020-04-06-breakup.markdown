Today's prompt: "A never-ending breakup"

Autoimmune diseases are sort of like your body breaking up with itself. A continuous breakup on the cellular level. White blood cells that once kept your other cells safe now go on the attack against them.

Breakup. Breakdown? Tearing cellular walls asunder. War on a microscopic level.

Giant cell myocarditis, huh? Man, I didn't know that was even a thing.
