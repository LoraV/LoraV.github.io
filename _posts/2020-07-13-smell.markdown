Today's prompt: "The smell of a place you love"

You love the scent of damp loam rising to your nostrils as you break the crust of earth with your trowel, making room for seed potatoes in the vegetable plot in the back yard, sprouting bulbs near the sidewalk in the front. As your fingers form divots for lettuce seed, you imagine your fingernails capturing the rich smell of the ground.

This was of no comfort to you when you were bound and buried alive, and the dirt was heaped upon you spadeful by spadeful. It wasn't even good loamy soil. It was mostly clay.
