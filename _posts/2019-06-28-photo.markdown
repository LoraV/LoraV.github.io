Today's prompt: "Find a photograph. Write the story of what's happening outside the frame."

In the photo, you're at the state fair, riding the Kamikaze. You're raising your arms above your head -- or, rather, below them. You're suspended upside down. You're laughing. Your metaphorical cup runneth over with bliss. You couldn't be more delighted.

Just out of frame, the carny running the ride has an expression of horror as he watches the cable snap.
