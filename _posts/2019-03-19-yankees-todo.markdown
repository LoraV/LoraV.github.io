Today's prompt: "The general manager of the New York Yankees' personal to-do list"

From the Desk of Harold George Steinbrenner III:

To-Do List:

~~Buy up all the good players.~~
~~Swim through vault of money like Scrooge McDuck.~~
~~Bask in the hatred of all who surround me.~~
~~Make sacrifice to the Outer Gods who keep our family in power from generation to generation.~~
Take a baseball bat to the head of that fucker [insert-your-name-here] who shows up at games with signs saying "Steinbrenner sold his soul to the Outer Gods."
Go to sleep, dreaming of money.
