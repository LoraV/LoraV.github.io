Today's prompt: "Pick your most cherished political view and convincingly argue the other side." [Taking some major liberties with this one.]

Look, I think we can all agree that the anti-miscegenation laws of yore were rascist and vile. And certainly we can agree that laws banning gay marriage were equally bigoted. But laws banning marriage between Old Ones and humans are just common sense. The body count we've seen in relationships like these ought to be enough of an argument by itself. Susanna Birch and Arwassa -- she ends up with her head bitten off by the freaky toothless mouth on Arwassa's neck. Jonathan Somerset and Yhagni -- Yhagni ends up feeding off of him like a parasite, as she does with all her other victims. [Insert-your-name-here] and Xotli -- they were frozen by the dark vortex of frigid air Xotli manifested as. It's tragic, really.
