Today's prompt: "Two paramedics have a patient in the back of the ambulance. The patient has only about 30 minutes to live. It could take 20 minutes or more to get to the hospital. What's goign on in the ambulance?"

The paramedics are so busy using the defibrillator on you and monitoring your vitals that they don't notice the driver has missed his exit, tacking on another 15 minutes of travel time.
