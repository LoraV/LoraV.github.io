Today's prompt: "Imagine yourself at age eighty. What would you tell yourself?"

Wait, is this what you're supposed to say to 80-year-old you? Or what 80-year-old you would say to you? Oh, wait, older you is speaking.

"I'm not eeeiiighty-year-old youuuuuu. I'm ghooooost youuuuuu," ghost you says. "We diiiiied a loooooong tiiiime agooooo. But we diiiiiied doing what we loooooved. Eeeeeeating Taco Belllll...."
