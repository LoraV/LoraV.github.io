Today's prompt: "A houseplant is dying. Tell it why it needs to live."

"You've got to be strong. You've got to carry on."

The philodrendon's yellowed leaves and wilting stem are unaffected by your pleas.

"Come on, plant, you have to live! After all," you sputter, the blood from your throat pooling around the philodrendon's pot, "one of us has to."
