Today's prompt: "The most troubling phone call you hope you never receive"

"Hello?"

Breathing comes through the receiver. Not like a heavy breathing kind of thing -- there's an edge of rising panic to it.

"They're coming," a familiar voice says. You can't quite place it.

"Who's coming?"

"I don't know. But they're dangerous." The voice seems to be coming through speakerphone, and there's a hint of an echo. "You have to go get help. Don't let them...."

You hear a pair of dress shoes clacking closer to whoever's holding the phone, echoing through some cavernous structure.

"There you are," a voice you've never heard before says. "We've been looking for you."

"No. Please, no!" the familiar voice cries out. And then it hits you. 

That's your voice.

There's a gunshot. Then the same footsteps, coming closer. And then the call goes dead.

And now you're running. You don't know what to do next. You just know you have to get out of there. You have to get in your car and drive far, far away.

You dash down several flights of stairs and into the parking garage. There's your car. You run to it, and you're fumbling for your keys when you hear a sound. It's the sound a phone makes when you've just dialed a number and hear the rings of the other phone. You look around and see the glow of the phone, sitting on the hood of your car. You pick it up, just as the person on the other end of the phone picks up.

"Hello?"

It's your voice.

You hear a familiar pair of clacking dress shoes echoing through the parking garage.

"They're coming," you say.
