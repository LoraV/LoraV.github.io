Today's prompt: "Write a recipe for disaster."

2 Old Ones, rivals

2 1/2 cups fanatical worshippers, divided

The blood of one virgin

A pinch of mystic artifacts

3 cups innocent bystanders, including yourself

1/4 cup raisins

Soak raisins in water until plump; drain. Sift half the fanatical worshippers with the first of the Old Ones and the mystic artifacts. Let stand until frothy. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining fanatical worshippers with the second of the Old Ones, along with the blood of a virgin. Mix until a doughlike mass forms. Add second Old One mixture to first; stir to combine. Add bystanders in, about a half cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Knead. Form into loaves. Bake at 350 degrees for several eons. Throw the raisins away.
