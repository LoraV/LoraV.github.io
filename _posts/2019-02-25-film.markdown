Today's prompt: "Your favorite moment in film"

Hands down, it's got to be that iconic moment in *Alien* when the chestburster erupts from Kane's torso. Absolutely terrifying -- the physical violation of it all, forced to be a human incubator for another species' young, only to die with their violent birth.

So when Atlach-Nacha, the Spinner in Darkness, chooses you to be the host for its egg sac, and millions of baby spiders with human faces hatch, then gush from your body -- first through your mouth, then forcing their own openings, coming through intestines, through stomach lining, through artery walls -- you have something to relate to.
