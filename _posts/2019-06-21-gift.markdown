Today's prompt: "An unexpected gift"

You hear the zombies shuffling closer to your house. 

You turn up the Christmas music.

You and Jordan sit cross-legged in the glow of multicolored LEDs peeking from between faux evergreen needles, and kiss. 

"Merry Christmas," you say, handing Jordan a package that's surprisingly heavy for its size. "Uh, be real careful opening that."

Jordan tears off the wrapping paper, opens the box, and takes out a lead-lined container. "Is this...?"

"Plutonium," you say. "I know you needed something radioactive to create your cure for zombieism. I had to trade away the last gun in my arsenal to get it, but it's worth it. We can do it now. We can save the world."

"I can't believe you were able to find this." Tears well up in Jordan's eyes. "I didn't think there was any way we'd ever get the fissile material I needed for the cure. That's why I traded all the remaining cure ingredients that had any value to them in exchange for ammunition." Jordan nudges a brightly wrapped present toward you.

You pick up the box from Jordan, unwrap it, and cut the packing tape holding down the lid flaps. Inside are several boxes of .223 Remington rounds.

You look at the ammo. You look at the plutonium. And then you start to laugh. Jordan laughs, too. The zombies shuffle closer.
