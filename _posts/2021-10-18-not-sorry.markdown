Today's prompt: "I was not sorry."

I was not sorry for putting bear traps in your bed, for putting laxatives in your water supply, for putting rotten meat in your air ducts, for loosing wild dogs in your house. I wasn't even that sorry that the gas leak actually killed you, although I would have taken giving you hallucinations. 

You know what you did.
