Today's prompt: "A letter to the editor"

I have always believed in a pluralistic society. When Donald Trump first tried to implement his Muslim ban, I was cheering on the ACLU attorneys who mobilized in the airports to help out the refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries who were caught in the middle. I was horrified when white supremacists murdered people at Jewish centers and black churches. Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains ... it takes all of us to make a world.

But something has got to be done about those Cultists. Worship traditions are one thing, but human sacrifice is quite another. They killed my neighbor [insert-your-name-here] just last night! Your religious rights end where my nose begins.
