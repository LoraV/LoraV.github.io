Today's prompt: "It was the first time he had ever gotten into a fight, and it was in a _____ of all places."

It was the first time you had ever gotten into a fight, and it was in a digestive tract of all places. And you battled valiantly with that esophagus, but I'm afraid your efforts were to no avail. Maybe if you were a more highly trained pugilist, you could have fought your way out of the giant monster's belly, but you are, both figuratively and comparatively, kind of a lightweight here.
