Today's prompt: "Waiting"

Waiting for death sounds like something you'd ascribe either to the residents of a nursing home or to an emo kid who's listened to his Smiths albums a few too many times in a row. But it also applies to you. Death can't come soon enough for you. Of course, that's what happens when your method of death a) has already begun, and b) is "being devoured alive by maggots."
