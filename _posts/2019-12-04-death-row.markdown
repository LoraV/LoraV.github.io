Today's prompt: "It's your first day on Death Row. Plan the next ten years of your life in this eight-by-ten cell, as you wait for your day to come."

Days 1 through 3,652: Eat terrible food. Daydream of life outside. Regret what you did (a little). Regret that you got caught (a lot). Do pushups. Read. Make marks on the walls of your cell. Exhaust your appeals.

Day 3,653: Die.
