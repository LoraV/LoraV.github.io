Today's prompt: "Interview a person you think you know well. Ask questions you've never before asked."

You: Hey, Cthuhu, we've known each other for a while now, right?  
Cthuhu: For about as long as I've known any sub-Elder God, sure.  
You: What do you like to eat when you're not eating humans?  
Cthulhu: Mostly I just like eating humans.  
You: Right, but, variety's the spice of life. What else do you like to eat?  
Cthulhu: I had a peanut butter and banana sandwich once. It was pretty good.  
You: You had a peanut butter and banana sandwich?  
Cthulhu: I mean, not intentionally. It just happened to be in a human's pocket.  
You: Oh, cool. Do you think you could live off of peanut butter and banana sandwiches?  
Cthulhu: "Live off?"  
You: You know. Subsist on.  
Cthulhu: I do not live in the way your limited sub-Elder God mind can process.  
You: Okay.  
Cthulhu: I exist outside of space and time.  
You: Okay.  
Cthulhu: I do not require food for subsistence.  
You: Okay.  
Cthulhu: That doesn't mean I don't get hungry.  
You: Of course! Of course.  
Cthulhu: You get it. 
You: So could you be sated with peanut butter and banana sandwiches?  
Cthulhu: Don't be ridiculous.  
You: But they've got protein, and potassium.  
Cthulhu: They also get stuck to the roof of your mouth.  
You: Sure, but--  
Cthulhu: And humans have that nice bone crunch and those juicy insides.  
You: Right.  
Cthulhu: So who did you bring for me to eat today?  
You: So, uh, I was thinking. How about a nice sandwich today? I've got a bunch of bananas in my kitchen, and a loaf of bread, and some peanut butter.  
[Pause.]  
Cthulhu: How many slices of bread are there?  
You: Let's see. I had a couple sandwiches already from it, so it looks like maybe, sixteen?  
Cthulhu: So, enough for eight sandwiches.  
You: Sixteen, if we make them open face.  
Cthulhu: Don't be crass, they're messy enough as is. Let's have a look at those bananas.  
You (holding up bananas): Here they are.  
Cthulhu: Those are verging on black already.  
You: They're great for banana bread that way!  
Cthulhu: What's the weight on that loaf of bread?  
You: The wrapper says 24 ounces.  
Cthulhu: And those bananas. How much do they weigh?  
You: Maybe a couple pounds?  
Cthulhu: And how much do you weigh?  
You: That's kind of a personal quetion.  
Cthulhu: A lot more than eight sandwiches.  
You: I could always make a run to the store.  
Cthulhu: I'm _very_ hungry.  
You: ...So aside from eating, what do you like to do in your spare time?  
Cthulhu: _Very_ hungry.
