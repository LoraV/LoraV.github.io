Today's prompt: "Storyboard a comic."

Panel 1: A stick figure version of you is walking down an ordinary-looking street, whistling a happy tune.   
Panel 2: Stick figure you's eyes bug out of their sockets as a dozen stick figure cultists leap out from off panel and attack stick figure you, massive knives drawn and cruel smiles on their faces.   
Panel 3: Stick figure you lies in the middle of the road with X's for eyes and a tongue hanging out of your mouth.
