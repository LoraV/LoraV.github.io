Today's prompt: "Summarize your dog's life in fewer than four paragraphs."

Your dog does not go to the dog park nearly as often as he would like to. Maybe his new owners will take him there more often. 

Your dog likes sniffing other dogs' butts, playing fetch, and rolling on dead things. It used to be he couldn't do any of those things inside your house. Now he can do one of them. Guess which one.

Your dog's favorite food is a lamb and vegetable formula, preferably supplemented with a few leftovers from your plate, but in lieu of that for the next few days I guess he'll just have to make do with your decaying corpse.
