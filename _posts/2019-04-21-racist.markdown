Today's prompt: "The first time you were worried that you had come off sounding racist"

"Oh, no, it's a Cthulhu!" you scream as you run down the street.

"Wait, what?" says Ob'mbu as it stops in its tracks. "Dude, what the fuck? I'm Ob'mbu. I'm not Cthulhu. Cthulhu and I don't look anything alike. He's got head-tentacles and webbed arms and bat wings. I'm a reptilian that's shaped like a giraffe."

"Oh. I just meant, you're like one of those old ones...."

"Great Old Ones."

"Right, right. And, like, Cthulhu is the best-known Great Old One, so I figured --"

"You figured we're all interchangable, somehow? What, do we all look the same to you? Do you call all black people Denzel Washington?"

"Well, no, that just wouldn't make any sen--"

"But it's okay to call all Great Old Ones 'Cthulhu'?"

"Are you calling me a racist?" you ask defensively.

"Wait, are you one of those assholes who think it's worse to call someone racist than it is to actually say racist shit? Man, I don't even normally devour humans, but for you, I'm going to make an exception."
