Today's prompt: "The art of love"

You might be familiar with the five love languages: acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, and physical touch. Does a shrine count as a gift? That seems like the most obvious section, but I think you could make an argument for act of service if there was a lot of effort put into building the shrine or, as in this instance where there's an altar in the midst of the shrine, keeping it full of human sacrifices. Anyway, the guy who killed you clearly loves Cthulhu, and has mastered that particular art of love. And, given all the pictures of His Tentacledness pasted all over the altar, the art of decoupage.
