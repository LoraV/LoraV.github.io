Today's prompt: "A newly invented product that will change your life"

"Have you tried the Tingler yet?"

"No. I keep hearing good things, but I just can't get past the name."

"Haha, yeah. A little joke by the guys who made it. You name it something like that and people figure it's just going to tickle a little, maybe make them a little numb. Nobody expects it's going to explode every capillary in their body, liquefy the tissue of their lungs and boil all the moisture in their eyeballs." 

"I still think the name sounds like a sex toy."

"It's really quite incredible, being able to cause such excruciating pain with the touch of a button."

"It doesn't help that it's shaped like a dildo."

"Look, just try mine once. It'll change your life."

"All right, all right." He takes the rubbery pink rod from his friend, points it at you, and presses the button. A bolt of something like electricity bursts from the end of it. Violent spasms of pain overtake your body as all of your organs implode, explode, melt, evaporate, and collapse into a quivering, fleshy puddle with bone shards sticking out of it.

"Holy crap, you weren't kidding."

"Right?"

"I have got to get me one of these!"
