Today's prompt: "An elaborate and complicated lie"

Oh, that's not Cthulhu. Uh, I redecorated. It's all papier mâché. Yeah. Papier mâché stalactites are in this year, don't you know? And I just adore that shade of green.

What? No, the tentac-- the stalactites didn't move. I mean, maybe they did a little, but it's probably just air currents. The ceiling fan's on in the other room, right? That's probably it.

Okay, yeah, I saw it move that time. It's probably an earthquake. I'll just check Twitter to see if anyone else felt the tremors. 

No, you definitely didn't hear me summoning Cthulhu! I was just doing some yoga and chanting my mantra. 

It's a new kind of yoga that you do in your jeans. They call it Jeans Yoga.

"Fhtagn" means "mindfulness." We chant "fhtagn" all the time in Jeans Yoga.
