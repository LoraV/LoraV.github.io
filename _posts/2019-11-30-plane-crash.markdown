Today's prompt: "You are the pilot of a jumbo jet, just realizing the plane may crash. What will you tell the crew and the passengers?"

"Good evening, passengers of Flight 1642 bound for Minneapolis," you say into the microphone. "I appear to have been possessed by the ghosts of 27 seagulls who are pretty angry about having been sucked into jet engines. They have merged with my intelligence, but are controlling my movements and have forced me to program in a new flight plan that will crash us into the ocean. So, turns out animals have souls and ghosts exist. Squawk squawk!"
