Today's prompt: "The perfect crime -- and what could go wrong"

You're lowering yourself with a winch and harness combo through the skylight toward a glass case displaying a diamond the size of your fist, when the metal ring attaching your harness to the rope, not designed to hold more than 50 pounds of weight, stretches open. You plummet toward the case, which shatters when you hit it, and die instantly when a shard impales your heart.

That's what you get for acquiring your equipment at Dick's Budget Harness Rentals 'N' More.
