Today's prompt: "A lie you told and got away with"

"Wolf! Wolf!" you yell, running through the town. This is going to be so hilarious, you think. These dummies are going to run out of their houses and chase after this wolf that doesn't even exist.

Except even though you'd _intended_ it as a lie, it wasn't _actually_ a lie.

The villagers are unable to save you from the wolf as it pounces upon you from the shadows and tears you limb from limb. But they will forever tell the story of the brave child who warned the town, at the risk of their own life, when a ravenous, bloodthirsty wolf came to devour everything in the village.
