Today's prompt: "Pick your favorite movie. Now switch the sex of the lead. Adjust the plot accordingly."

You know, it really doesn't matter that in this version, Buttercup becomes the Dread Pirate Roberta and rescues her darling Wesley from Princess Humperdink (which maybe isn't a great name for a princess, but it's not a great name for a prince either). You're still Count Rugen, and you still get slaughtered by Inigo Montoya in a very satisfying revenge scene.
