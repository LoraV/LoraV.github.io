Today's prompt: "The poorest you've ever been"

"Oh man," you say, pushing three ants onto a plastic spoon, "I'm so poor, if it wasn't for bugs, I'd starve to death."

"Excuse me," a man in a suit approaches you and pulls some paperwork out of a briefcase. "I'm sorry, but the bank is repossessing this anthill."
