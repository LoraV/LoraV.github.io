Today's prompt: "Describe _ascent_ using the most innovative, outrageous metaphors, similes, and physical descriptions you can think of."

Ascent -- the Old Ones mushroom-clouding up from the bottom of the ocean, breaking the surface like the rotting carcass of a whale filled with gas produced by bacteria eating away at its core. Ascent -- they rise, as though the ocean currents were an escalator, ready to launch Cthulhu and his cronies onto the land. Ascent -- they explode from the water and violate the skies, backs arched, wings unfurling, voices roaring.

And there you are, a morsel on the shore.
