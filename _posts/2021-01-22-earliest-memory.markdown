Today's prompt: "Re-create your earliest childhood memory"

Your earliest memory is of something truly mammoth -- way bigger than mama and dada -- towering over your crib. Big green snaky things came from out of its mouth. It spoke in a loud and gutteral voice, words you didn't understand then and wouldn't understand now, but the pure sound of which made you cry then, and probably would have sent tremors through your spine if you heard it today.

If some scholar in ancient tomes and otherworldly languages were around, they might have been able to translate what this being said as, "Later. When you've fattened up a bit."
