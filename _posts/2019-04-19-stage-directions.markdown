Today's prompt: "Write stage directions for an actor that insult him or her personally all along the way."

*You knock, like a moron. If any nefarious figures within the house weren't already aware of your presence, they are now. After a moment, you enter stage left, fully oblivious to the danger around you.*

YOU: Hello? Is anybody home?

*In your naivete, you walk center stage past the staircase, failing utterly to check the room and opening yourself up to attacks from all sides. Hooded Figure 1, carrying a scythe, silently walks down the stairs, unnoticed by you, who are far to unobservant to pick up on such things.*

YOU: I was driving past the house when I thought I heard a scream. Is everybody okay?

*You walk stage right, still foolishly unaware of your surroundings. Seriously, what kind of nincompoop just walks into a house like that when there could be danger? Hooded Figure 1 continues down the stairs. Hooded Figure 2 enters quietly from the kitchen (up stage left).*

YOU: Hellooooo....

*You exit stage right. Hooded Figures 1 and 2 follow. You scream, offstage, an inevitable victim of your own folly.*
