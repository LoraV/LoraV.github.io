Today's prompt: "Watch three spectators at a ball game and describe each one as a different animal."

There's the lady in the bleachers one row up and to the right of you. She scoops up handfuls of popcorn into her hand and, instead of bringing her hand up to her mouth, brings her mouth down to her hand, like a chicken pecking at grains on the ground.

And there's the man at the railing below your bleacher section, pacing back and forth, back and forth, back and forth like a watchful panther.

And there's the man just to the back and the right of you, laughing uproariously at everything his companions say, like a hyena.

And then they all actually turn into their spirit animals. Except for the lady, who turns into a giant chicken instead of a regular chicken.

And they converge on you and peck, maul, bite you to death.

I guess you just didn't have sufficient team spirit.
