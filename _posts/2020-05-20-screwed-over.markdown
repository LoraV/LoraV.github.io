"Seriously, what did I do wrong?" you wail, your wrists tugging at your shackles.

"Right? Wrong? That's not what this is about," the man in the expressionless white mask and hooded black robe says as he holds another Phillips head screw up to your chest and presses his finger into the trigger of his cordless drill.
