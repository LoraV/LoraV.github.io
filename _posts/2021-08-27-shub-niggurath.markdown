Today's prompt: "Start a story with the line 'Everyone whispered about _____, but no one had the courage to talk to her.'"

Everyone whispered about Shub-Niggurath, but no one had the courage to talk to her. Or the ability, really. Her Dark Young serve as her proxies. You want to talk to Shub-Niggurath, to pledge yourself to her, to worship her? You talk to them. Human peons don't get to talk to the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. They get to talk to this kind of slimy, tentacly, tree-looking thing that smells like a corpse. And they're real hard to get hold of, too. When someone wants to summon them, they have to look up the summoning ritual in the _Book of Eibon_, go to the woods at the darkest of the moon, and sacrifice a victim on a stone altar. It's both barbaric and maddeningly inefficient in a day of instant communication. It's like, they're going to all this trouble -- kidnapping you, tying you up and gagging you, marching you out to the woods, and slaughtering you -- just to use you like some kind of human pager for one of Shub-Niggurath's stinky, oozing lackeys.
