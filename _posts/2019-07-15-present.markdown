Today's prompt: "A present from your mother"

"I hope you like it!" the card from your mother reads. "The shopkeeper said it was the Amulet of Myrr-Kasham (not sure on the spelling of that). She said it protects the wearer from Ngyr-Korath. Not sure on the spelling of that, either, but she said he's also called 'The Ultimate Abomination' and 'The Dream-Death,' and that he comes as a turquoise mist that invokes dread in everyone he gets close to. She said he got really mad when life began and he's already eaten several stars. Funny, huh? Anyway, I thought it would bring out your eyes. Happy birthday!"

Unfortunately, when Ngyr-Korath arrived on Earth, still pissed about the existence of life, it was the day before your birthday and the pendant was still sitting in its package.
