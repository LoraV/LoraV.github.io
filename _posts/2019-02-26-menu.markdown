Today's prompt: "The menu for your last meal"

John Wayne Gacy's last meal was a bucket of KFC, 12 fried shrimp, and a pound of strawberries. Timothy McVeigh's last meal was two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Ted Bundy waived his special meal request, so he got Florida's traditional last meal of a medum-rare steak, eggs over easy, hash browns, toast, milk and juice.

Your last meal was a teriyaki chicken rice bowl and a Diet Coke. Cthulhu's most recent meal was you.
