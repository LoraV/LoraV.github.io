Today's prompt: "The first lie you were caught in"

The first lie you were caught in was something about how your brother had started it, when, although you hadn't realized it, your mom had witnessed the whole thing.

The last lie you were caught in: "Oh, yeah, I'm with you guys. All hail Cthulhu, right? Fin-gluey muggle-waffle Cthulhu real yeah something something f-tag-un!"
