Today's prompt: "Write a list of things to do before you die."

My bucket list includes finishing turning all of the writing prompts in this book into death scenes, maybe doing a podcast of some of them and a Choose Your Own Adventure book of all death scenes, writing a couple comic books and graphic novels, traveling to Japan, and making my own sausage.

I don't know what's on your bucket list, but if I was to make a list of the things you were going to do before you die, it would have two items on it:
1. Look behind you.
2. Scream.
