Based on your research into eldritch beings, you know there are a number of elder gods that have gelatinous forms. There's Ghisguth, which your books call “a titanic mass of jellylike material”;  Eihort, a “pallid, gelatinous oval with many eyes and legs”; and Yog-Sapha, the multicolored, glowing, amoebic, gelatinous mass. Without your books and diagrams, you're relatively certain that this one is Ghisguth, but it could be Yog-Sapha. It's hard to tell in this light. One thing's for sure: You weren't ready for this jelly.
