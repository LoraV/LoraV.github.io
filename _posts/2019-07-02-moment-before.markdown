You clinked glasses and felt the whiskey burn your throat.

"Woo!" the monster said as he returned his glass to the table. "Is it supposed to taste like fire?"

"Oh, yes," you say. "I should have warned you."

Dimples stretch out toward the bolts in his neck as he smiles. "Fire good."

And that's when you heard the ruckus outside.
