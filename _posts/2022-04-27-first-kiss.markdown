Today's prompt: "Your first kiss"

The bottle wobbles on its clockwise path. Please let it be River please let it be River please please please you'll never ask for anything else

It stops with the neck pointing right at Cthulhu. Dammit.

"Kiss!" Kara shouts. A chant quickly breaks out, and the other kids around the circle start beating their thighs with their fists or slapping the floor to keep time: Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss

Cthulhu reaches a clawed hand out to you and bends his face down to your eye level. You swallow, and force a smile. Might as well get this over with.

You aim a little under the tentacles, figuring that's where his lips are. The next few seconds, your face is flooded with sensations -- cold, moist, a little slimy. You feel a gentle tug at the corner of your mouth as one of his tentacles slides between your lips and along the edges of your molars. He's exploring your mouth with a few cautious tendrils. Your lips begin to feel numb, and then your tongue, and then your gums.

And then, of course, he devours you whole.
