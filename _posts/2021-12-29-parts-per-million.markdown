Today's prompt: "Begin with 'It didn't seem like much at the time...'"

It didn't seem like much at the time, at least not to the FDA, which allows 10 whole insects in eight ounces of golden raisins, 450 insect parts in a 16-oz. box of spaghetti, and 20 maggots in a 4-oz. can of mushrooms. But try telling that to the giant cockroach who has showed up at your door with murder in her eyes, furious at you for eating bits of her children in that PB&J you had for lunch.
