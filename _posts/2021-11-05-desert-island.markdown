Today's prompt: "You've been stranded on an island for five years now. Describe your typical day."

Later today, I'll try to catch a few fish while it's still cool and the insects are out and the fish are catching their breakfast. Then I'll check the traps and see if I've caught any of those muskrat-looking creatures. I'll desalinate some water. I'll dig up some roots. I'll roast anything I've caught or gathered. I've got my routines down now. After all, it's been five years since the plane crash. Four years and eight months since you got that look in your eye, that it's-you-or-me look, that these-supplies-would-last-much-longer-for-one look. And because of that, there's one very important part of my routine, the thing I do before I go out to catch fish or check traps or gather roots or tend to the fire. The first thing I do every morning is drink some desalinated water out of your skull.
