Today's prompt: "Retell the most recent joke you've heard as a short piece of fiction." (I don't remember what the last joke I heard was, so I'm going with this one.)

Okay, so there's these two muffins baking in an oven. And the first one says, "Jeez, it's hot in here." And the second one says, "Oh my god, a talking muffin!" And the first one says, "No, no, I'm a human being who's been magically transformed into muffin batter! Oh god, no, I wasn't made to withstand these temperatures! Oh my god, I'm literally being cooked alive!"

And that muffin was you.
