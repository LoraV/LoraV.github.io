Today's prompt: "You know when it comes to a decision between the job that pays well and the job that's fun? He made the colossal mistake of picking the fun job."

"Yeah, it's not as cool as you think," you have to tell people at parties after you tell them you're a video game tester. 

Your first job was playing Wii Bowling. It wasn't what you'd dreamed of, the next Super Smash Bros. or Call of Duty, but it was kind of fun at first. But imagine playing Wii Bowling 40 hours a week for eight months. And the one thing that would break up the monotony is when the game calculated your score incorrectly or it didn't switch between players properly or the gutterball actually got stuck in the gutter and your screen froze, and you got to enter a bug. It. Was so. Boring. You realized before long that you were grateful you weren't assigned one of your favorite games. Your job would have ruined it for you.

Your next assignment was Red Dead Redemption II. Now all your friends love that game, and you hate it.

The third game you were assigned was The Ring: Samara's Revenge.
