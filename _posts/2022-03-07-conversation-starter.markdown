Today's prompt: "The most intriguing and/or unexpected conversation you've had with a complete stranger"

A tall, fat man sits down on the bench next to you. You glance up quickly from your phone, then immediately back down. Something about him is vaguely unsettling.

He sits quietly for a while. You continue to stare at your phone. You can feel the tall, fat man watching you.

The tall, fat man's stomach gurgles loudly. He scoots closer to you. You're sitting cross-legged on the bench, so it takes you a second to scoot away, and before you can, a drip of something lands on the knee of your jeans.

You glance at the tall, fat man and notice a rivulet of drool trickling from the corner of his mouth to his chin. You barely repress a shudder, scoot away again, and look back at your phone.

At last he clears his throat. You glance up at him briefly, and back to your phone, trying to avoid his keen interest in you.

"Have you ever met someone with three rows of teeth?" he asks you.

You look up, and cannot look away from the the most horrific grin you have ever seen in your life.
