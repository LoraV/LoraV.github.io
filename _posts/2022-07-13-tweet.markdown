A surprising number of the Old Ones are on Twitter. Volgna-Gath is a little disappointing; they only have two tweets. Shub-Niggurath tweets in both English and French. One of the best, of course, is @cthulhu4america,  Cthulhu's 2020 presidential campaign account. “Why is Jeff Sessions against Americans opening their minds to the dark eternal vistas of the universe?”, he tweeted on Jan. 4, 2018, and the day before that, “It's not the size of your button that is important, it's the potency of your will to unleash all-consuming chaos and madness in the wake of your ascension.” His campaign slogans are “Why vote for the lesser evil?” and “America First – then, the world.” But it looks like he's willing to amend that and start with you.
