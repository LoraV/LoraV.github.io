It seems like you've been trapped in this creepy house for ages while the storm rages outside. You decide to curl up with a good book. The library is mostly a bust, though. There's several tomes in languages you're not familiar with â€“ for some, you're not even sure it's human language. There's some dullsville pamphlet called _On the Sending Out of the Soul_, and an equally snore-inducing volume called _Revelations of Gla'aki_. You finally settle on a play called _The King in Yellow_. A few hours later, your killers find you curled up, clutching your knees, rocking back and forth and gibbering. You don't remember how they kill you. All you know now is madness.
