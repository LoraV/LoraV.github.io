Today's prompt: "The orchestra on the *Titanic* famously kept playing as the ship went down. Describe the sinking of the *Titanic* from the point of view of the musicians playing in the ballroom -- from their interactions to the sights, sounds, and sensations they experience as the ship sinks."

The ship shudders.

You play on. 

Passengers scream.

You play on.

Men and women run across your field of vision, stumbling as the ship lurches.

You play on.

Cold water splashes against your ankles, soaking your pant legs.

You play on.
