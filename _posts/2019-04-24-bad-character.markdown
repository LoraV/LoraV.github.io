Today's prompt: "Do a detailed character sketch for a fictional character about whom you would never, ever want to write. Work to avoid making up anything that would capture your own interest."

You wake up at 6 a.m., all smiles and eager to start your day, having gone to bed early last night after watching a few educational videos about personal hygiene. After toweling off from your shower, you put on your favorite pants -- those khakis with the front pleats -- and your favorite light gray polo shirt, buttoned all the way up to the top. 

You make your lunch, slathering mayonnaise on two slices of Wonder Bread and topping them with two Kraft Singles. Ahh, processed American cheese. The perfect sandwich. You drop it into a brown bag with a Red Delicious. 

And now it's on to breakfast. Decaf coffee and a bowl of plain oatmeal.

You stir your oatmeal, scoop out a big spoonful, and suddenly pitch forward, face down, dead, into the bowl.

Sorry, I couldn't get your cause of death. I was too busy yawning.
