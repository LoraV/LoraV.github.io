Today's prompt: "Jot down a list of things that make you angry."

Injustice   
Attempts at disenfranchisement   
The threat of white supremacy and Christian nationalism   
Attacks on vulnerable populations, like transgender children and immigrants   
Mansplaining     
The way you got murdered by that guy in a Pepe the Frog costume
