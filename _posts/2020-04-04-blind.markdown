Today's prompt: "The point of view of a blind person"

I'm sure watching your death would have been frightening, but only being able to hear your screams, the earth-shaking footsteps running toward you, the rending of your sinews, the gigantic jaws of gigantic monsters crunching your bones, and the dripping of your viscera -- now that was truly horrifying.
