Today's prompt: "Write the menu for a restaurant -- including names for dishes and descriptions of flavors and ingredients. Then rewrite it for the delivery/to-go menu. The delivery menu must be half as long, but just as tantalizing."

#### Cafe Veleno

##### Insalata

###### House Salad   
Mixed greens -- butter lettuce, arugula, baby spinach, and henbane leaves -- topped with garlicky croutons, chopped fresh tomatoes, grated carrots, sliced radishes, pickled red onion slices, and diced water hemlock. Dressed with our signature lemon-oregano vinaigrette.

##### Pasta

###### Wild Mushroom Ravioli
Morel, chanterelle, and amanita phalloides mushrooms, beautifully sauteed and chopped fine, make the perfect filling for this classic pasta dish.

###### Spaghetti Bolognese
Our twist on the classic! A robust tomato sauce with grass-fed beef, pancetta, and local carrots and celery served over freshly made pasta, finished with a drizzle of antifreeze.


##### Secondo

###### Chicken Piccata
Tender butterflied chicken breast lightly fried and served in a pan sauce with lemon juice, shallots, capers, and belladonna berries and decorated with thinly sliced lemon.

###### Osso Buco
Braised lamb shank slow-roasted with parsnips, celeriac, leeks and tomatoes. Served over a bed of rat poison.
