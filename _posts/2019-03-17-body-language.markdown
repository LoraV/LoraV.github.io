Today's prompt: "Write a scene in which a person is leaving a restaurant with her husband and bumps into a former lover. What words are exchanged or not exchanged? What do her body positions say?"

When you ran into Christine and her new husband Will in the parking lot outside Dickey's BBQ Pit, you didn't think anything of it. That was years ago, and you two just weren't a good match. You smile and nod, and move on towards the front door.

You didn't notice Christine's body language, which was clearly telling Will that you would be a perfect person to sacrifice in the bloody pentagram in their cult leader's basement. Of course, your back was turned when she got to the stabby motions, so you can't really blame yourself that they were able to surprise you.
