Today's prompt: "You're a Nigerian e-mail scammer. Write an e-mail that will convince the recipient to send you $200."

"Dearest friend," the email begins,

"I write to you today to inform you of a grave thret upon your person. There is a man standing behind you rite now who is holding a very sharp sord. He will execute you if you do no immediatly send $200USD to the account linked [here](https://yuhdead.com/death/scenes/2020/07/17/scam/ "No, I won't actually take your money").

"Yours very sincerly,

"Naomi Tunde   
"Princess of Nigeria"

You chuckle as you close the email. Of course you're not sending this scammer any money. And then you notice something moving in your peripheral vision. You turn your head just as the sword comes down on your neck.
