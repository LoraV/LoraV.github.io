Today's prompt: "The secret that, if revealed, would upset everything"

Look, I don't know why you need to exaggerate everything. The fact that Tharapithia, The Shadow in the Crimson Light, has been secretly tunnelling below your house and is going to burst through your floorboards and devour you whole, is certainly upsetting. But will it upset *everything*? In the grand scheme of things, no. You don't have to be all dramatic about it.
