Today's prompt: "Do you have a superstition? What is it, why do you have it, and how do you follow it?"

I hate to tell you this, but wearing the same pair of socks day in and day out will not protect you from Cthulhu. I've seen the future. I know what happens Thursday. Yes, I know the socks have Elder Signs woven into the design on the ankle, but the knit is too chunky for the representation of the symbol to have enough verisimilitude to be effective.
