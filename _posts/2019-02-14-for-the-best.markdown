Today's prompt: "A bad situation that turned out for the best"

The Cult of the Bloody Tongue slit your throat after using water torture, thumbscrews, and a tongue tearer on you. Which was a blessing, really. The Cult of the Bloody Tongue takes great pride in their craftsmanship, and about a month after your death, they completed work on an iron maiden, a rack, *and* a brazen bull.
