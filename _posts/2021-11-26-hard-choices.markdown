Today's prompt: "What is the most difficult decision you've ever made?"

You run down the hallway pursued by a rabid, snarling hybrid bear/pterodactyl/scorpion. You glance behind you as you run. It practically takes up the whole hallway. There's no going back.

The hallway ends in a small chamber with three doors.

One of them is labeled "Lava Pit."

One of them is labeled "The Vacuum of Space."

One of them is labeled "Giant Rotating Buzzsaws Galore!"
