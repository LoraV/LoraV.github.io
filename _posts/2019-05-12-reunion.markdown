Today's prompt: "Ten years now, you meet up with an old friend you haven't seen in a decade. Write the conversation you have."

"So. How've you been?" Alan asks.

"We're ... really ... doing this?" you ask?

"Well, yeah, we've got some time to kill," he says.

"Uh, fine I guess. I *was* doing fine."

He nods. "You still working at the same place?" 

"No, I changed careers a while back." Old habits kick in. "How are the kids?"

"Oh man, they've gotten so big, you wouldn't believe!" he brightens up. "Josh is in high school now, can you believe it?"

"God, I feel so old."

"And Emily, she took second place in a track meet last week. We're so proud."

"That's great." You pause. "So, you got into the whole cult thing, huh."

"Yep! I suppose that sounds pretty weird, but, what can I say other than Cthulhu fhtagn!"

"Ha ha, I guess. Uh. Don't suppose you could let me out of this sacrifice pit for old time's sake."

"Sorry man, no can do." A long pause. "Hey, you remember that one time in high school when Lance painted a scrotum on the vice principal's truck?"

You remain silent.

"That was pretty funny, huh?" Alan says.

You maintain your silence.

"Hey man, you don't gotta be like that. Just because we're sacrificing you."

"Fuck off, Alan."
