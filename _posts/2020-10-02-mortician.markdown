Today's prompt: "Describe a mortician's meeting with a newly bereaved family. Remember that he isn't just dealing with grief but selling a funeral package and getting necessary information about the deceased and the survivors."

"See, this is why you always read the local paper," the older mortician said to his younger employee after an incredibly awkward conversation with your family. "If you'd checked the front page this morning, you'd have known that family was going to need a closed casket."
