Today's prompt: "You are a brand-new suicide-hotline counselor. Describe how you feel during the course of your first call."

"This is the suicide hotline, how--" you begin.

"You're going to do it tonight after your shift," a voice cuts you off.

"What?" you stammer.

"You're going to die by suicide tonight after your shift. Round about 7:18."

"Excuse me? Is this a prank?"

"Pills," the voice says.

"Let me try this again. This is the suicide hotline. Have you been having any suicidal ideation?"

"No. I just want to report a planned suicide. Yours."

"Look, that -- that's not how suicide hotlines work."

"I don't make the rules either. Just the predictions. I'm sorry. I'm guessing it's going to be a rough night."
