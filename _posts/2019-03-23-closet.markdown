Today's prompt: "What's stored in your closet?"

The skulls of all of your victims, bleached after each kill you made to venerate the Old Ones and stacked on massive shelves, first neatly, then all stuck in helter-skelter, until the day an earthquake hit as you were adding your most recent kill to the closet and buried you under the bones of your victims.
