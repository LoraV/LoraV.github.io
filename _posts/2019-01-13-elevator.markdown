Today's prompt: "Put two people who hate each other in an elevator for 12 hours. What happens?"

It's not so much that the Tsavaroth demon hates you. It's more that he hates all human beings. If anything, you've got to admire his restraint. The two of you sat in a metal box trapped between floors 4 and 5 for hours on end. Why he endured half a day of you attempting to make idle chitchat and drumming your fingers on the elevator doors before gutting you with his claws, I can't say. But around hour 12, I guess he just got hangry.
