Today's prompt: "You have a time machine, but it can only go back in time two days. What would you change?"

You've studied the rites of the Old Ones for decades now. You were the foremost living expert on how to bring about -- or prevent -- the ascension of eldritch gods. So theoretically, if you could go back in time two days, you would have sought out the cultist assassin before she even accepted the job to kill you before you could prevent the ascension of Cthulhu. Lethal blow dart to her neck as she was plotting your demise. Or maybe you would have hired more bodyguards to ward against her plans. Unfortunately, the time machine requires a living participant, so, schucks.
