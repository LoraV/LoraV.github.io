Today's prompt: "Describe in detail an everyday object -- a piece of fruit, a water bottle, or your beat-up old wallet."

Wrinkles the width of a grain of rice crease the surface of the honey-not-so-crisp apple in your fridge. The skin is still a soft red with splotches of yellow radiating from the stem, but if you were to cut into it -- one of the many things you'll never again have an opportunity to do -- you would find a number of soft brown mealy spots. Fragments of the calyx, the bit at the bottom of an apple that used to be the center of the apple blossom, have dried up and flaked off and now decorate the bottom of your crisper drawer.

On the plus side, given the temperatures we're seeing in the northern hemisphere right now, it's decomposing at a much slower rate than you are in your shallow grave.
