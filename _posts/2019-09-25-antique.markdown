Today's prompt: "The oldest item in your possession"

The Amulet of Amrathka is a red stone surrounded by a circle of runes cast in silver. You found it in an antique store in Duluth. They clearly had no idea of the real value. You bought it, scrubbed away the tarnish, and you've been wearing it around your neck ever since. It grants you protection from Nctosa, the daughter of Cthulhu, with her spidery limbs and sharp claws.

Unfortunately, it does nothing to save you from her twin sister, Nctolhu.
