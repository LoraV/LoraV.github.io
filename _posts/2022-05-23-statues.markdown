The sculpture garden here is creepy A.F. Isn't regular statuary creepy enough with its blank, pupil-less eyes? Why did the sculptor for this place feel the need to carve half the statues with expressions of horror, and the other half with weird tentacles and eye stalks and bat wings? You had just finished looking at what looks like a statue of the Virgin Mary but with no eyes at all, and had moved on to a statue of a boy with waaay more teeth than seems normal, when from the corner of your eye you see something move. You turn, and nothing is there, just endless statues. You move on, and while admiring a young woman preserved mid-scream, you hear a skittering. You wheel around, but once more it's just statue after statue. The last thing you see is a statue of a woman covered by crawling insects. The attack comes from behind. It is swift, silent, and somehow cold.
