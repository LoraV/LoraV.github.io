Today's prompt: "Tell the true story of a dramatic moment in your life, but weave in one secret and one lie." [Sort of breaking this one since I'm still doing the second-person fiction thing, but it is inspiring me as to the setup.]

"You start, Ginny," you say.

"Let's see," she says, focusing her eyes in the middle distance and pausing for a few seconds. "Got it. I restore vintage motorcycles in my spare time, I have five cats, and I've never cooked anything more complicated than Kraft macaroni and cheese."

"It's the cats, isn't it?" Dana says. 

"Yeah, it could be the macaroni, but I think it's the cats," you say. 

Jake nods. Lance shrugs.

"You got me," Ginny said. "I only have three cats."

"That's cool about the motorcycles," you say. "I never would have guessed."

"You're next," Ginny says to Jake while swirling her glass of Merlot.

"Okay. I once spent a year in Guatemala without learning Spanish before I left. I published my own webcomic for three years. And once I went skinny dipping with friends and couldn't find my shorts afterwards, so I had to drive home in just my underwear."

"Uh, Guatemala?" you say.

"I think it's the skinny dipping one," Ginny says.

"I'm stumped," Dana says.

"I think Guatemala too," Lance says. 

"It was the skinny dipping one," Jake says.

"Oh, I should have known!" Dana says.

"Nice, Ginny," Lance says.

You look at Dana. "My turn?" she says.

"Yep," you reply.

"All right," she says. "I'm the god Olkoth, come to Earth in human form. I'm here to kill every last one of you at this party. And I'm deathly allergic to cheesecake," she says, punctuating her sentence by shoveling a forkful of New York style cheesecake into her mouth.
