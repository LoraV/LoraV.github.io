Today's prompt: "Describe a professor coming on to one of his students."

You watch a grimace flicker across the young woman's face as the man in the tweed jacket hovers behind her. "It's a basic cantrip, Celine." You're pretty sure she can feel his breath on her neck.

"I'm just not sure why we have to do this now. After hours, like this," the pretty blond woman in the dark robe says.

"You have to learn basic mind-flaying sometime," the professor says. "You're going to need to know it if you want to be a warlock. You *do* want to be a warlock, don't you?"

"Yes," she says softly, eyes cast down.

"Good. Now then --"

"I was just wondering why I can't learn this at the same time as the rest of the class."

He begins to pace behind her. "You know full well what the pass rate is for my class?"

"It's -- not high."

"Not all of your classmates are going to make it. Some of them are bright. Many of them are not. I would think a smart girl like you would want to take every advantage to get ahead."

"Of -- of course."

"All right then. Arms out."

She raises her arms then, and faces the wall where you are chained. "Mmmmmph," you say against your gag.

"No no no. Let's correct your form." The professor stands directly behind her, pressing against her back as he adjusts her arms slightly. Then he steps back, and as terrified as you are for your own life, you can't help but feel a slight sensation of relief for Celine now that the professor has stepped away. "All right. Go."

The pretty blond's eyes roll back in her head, and she chants in surprisingly deep tones. "Ahornah ymg' ftaghu mglagln ahmgep hup ymg' bthnkor. Ahornah ymg bthnkor mglagln ahmgep hup ymg' fst'mahgrn."

Your skin begins to peel away from your muscles, beginning at your fingertips and underneath your toenails, and quickly spreading up your calves and down your forearms. You scream in pain and horror as you watch the muscles in your feet unravel from their bones, the ligaments that once held them their splaying out in the open air.

As you die screaming, you can still see the creepy professor rest his hand on his student's shoulder. "Very good."
