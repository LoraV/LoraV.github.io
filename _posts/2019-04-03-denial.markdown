Today's prompt: "Start a story with the line 'When I confronted him, he denied that he'd ever said it.'"

When you confronted him, he denied that he'd ever said it.

"Sell my soul for a good Philly cheesesteak," he said. "That's ridiculous. I love a good cheesesteak as much as the next man, but you don't give up your soul for something like that."

"Good to hear," you say. "I know it's irrational, but I was worried, since I've heard how good the Brotherhood of the Black Pharoah's cheesesteaks are, and I know how much you love a good cheesesteak."

"Well, you needn't have worried. No matter how succulent, how tender, how juicy and mouthwatering and full of cheesy, peppery goodness a cheesesteak may be, I wouldn't part with my soul for one."

"Glad of it," you say. "Because I know the Brotherhood of the Black Pharoah drive a hard Faustian bargain."

"Yeah, they're downright pernicious. But I have my bright lines I won't cross. I wouldn't sell my soul for a cheesesteak," he says. "Of course, I never said I wouldn't kill for one."
