Today's prompt: "A scene that takes place in extreme cold"

This year I did a couple of reading challenges. When you read a lot of books, sometimes you'll find weird connections between them. Like how _Where'd You Go, Bernadette_ by Maria Semple and _Whiteout_ by Greg Rucka both contain fun facts about Antarctica. _Whiteout_ is on my bookshelf, so I can share a few from that book. Fun fact: While temperatures at the McMurdo research station on the Antarctic coast are typically around -5 degrees Celsius, which is warm enough for penguins, seals, insects and fish to survive in, the interior of Antarctica tends to stay at -70 degrees Celsius in the winter. Fun fact: Not even bacteria can survive at -70 degrees Celsius. Fun fact: Antarctica's Vostok Station once recorded -89.6 degrees Celsius, a world record temperature that's cold enough to freeze water vapor in your lungs. Fun fact: None of those temperatures are including wind chill, and winds sometimes get up to 320 kilometers an hour there. 

I don't know why you took that job in the Antarctic research station. And I don't know why you walked out of the station alone on a frigid, blustery November day. But here's another fun fact: You don't survive Antarctica.
