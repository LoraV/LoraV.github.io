Today's prompt: "Describe a person you've never met."

Thirteen feet tall. Three rows of teeth. Taut, muscly arms so long their fingertips nearly touch the ground. Spikes running down the length of their nose. Bloodshot eyes the color of an orange neon sign shining through smog. 

You've never met them before, but you're about to.
