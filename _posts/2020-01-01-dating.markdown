Today's prompt: "Write two descriptions of yourself for an online dating service. First, be the kind of guy/girl who'd be taken home to meet the mother. Then try a hot, sexy version."

##### About me

I try to keep my life centered on the important things -- family, friends, faith, and good barbecue. I enjoy coaching little league, baking apple crisp, and going on picnics.

##### I often catch myself thinking...

Where did I put my wrench?  
Gosh, what a good day for a hike.  
What Would Cthulhu Do?

##### Likes

Golden Retrievers, manning the grill, making human sacrifices to the Great Old Ones.

##### About me

I'm the person your mother warned you about.

##### I often catch myself thinking...

Where did I put my riding crop?
What a great day to go skydiving. Or skinny dipping.
How do you pronounce 'fhtagn,' again?

##### Likes

Motorcycles, the smell of leather, making human sacrifices to the Great Old Ones.
