Today's prompt: "Write a love letter to a person you dislike."

"Cthulhu, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways," you write.

"Thy strong tentacles constrict my chest.

"Though all your Cultists make their lives a quest

"To seek you, yet you found me. As you raise

"Yourself from ocean's depths, on man to graze,

"And other victims scream in their distress, 

"I eagerly wait for you to ingest

"My flesh, my self. So set this world ablaze

"And crush mankind beneath your monstrous feet.

"The end is nigh, but 'til my final breath

"My love for you will only grow in heat.

"Your choice to feed on me rewards my faith.

"Destruction is delicious; slaughter, sweet;

"And I shall love thee better with my death."
