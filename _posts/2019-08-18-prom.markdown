Today's prompt: "What did you wear to prom? How did you get your outfit, and what happened to it?" [Apologies to the male-identified reader, but we are talking dresses today.]

You and your girlfriends did a lot of looking online and shopping at the formal/bridal stores before you picked a dress. You've never tried on so many dresses in your life, and yes, it felt like a shopping montage in a movie where you'd walk out of the dressing room and people would shake their heads until you found something that suited you. And suit you it does. Your prom dress is a dark navy chiffon off-the-shoulder affair with a floor-length skirt, an A-line waist and a ruched bodice. It looks incredible paired with your drop earrings, your upswept hair, and your 3-inch platinum-colored spike heels. 

Your choice in footwear was your first regret of the evening. They're terrible for dancing, and even worse for running away when Ny-Rakath crashes the party. Your second regret of the evening was your choice in your prom date. When Ny-Rakath was headed straight toward the two of you, they pushed you aside to clear the way for their own exit. That wasn't very nice. And your third regret, as you die, gored by Ny-Rakath's many horns, is that your dress was so bloodied and torn in the attack that you won't be able to be buried in it. Which is a shame. It really does look good on you.
