Today's prompt: "Write a 'Dear John' letter, breaking up with your high-school sweetheart who's in the army."

Dear John,

It's not you.

It's the fact that I'm about to be murdered by a group of cultists who need a human sacrifice to bring the Old Ones to earth and usher in the end times.

I guess they're big fans of closure?

Stay safe. Much love,

[Your name]
