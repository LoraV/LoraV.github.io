Today's prompt: "Five things you wish you'd asked your grandmother or grandfather"

1. Hey, Grandpa, when you've died and I have to clear out your house, is there anything I should know?

2. Why on earth would you set so many death traps around your house?

3. Is there any off switch to this one?

4. How did you rig up the motion-sensing walls that are closing in on me, and the iron plates that have sprung up and sealed off all means of escape?

5. Where did you even get that many bayonets?
