Today's prompt: "What is the worst thing that you ever did?"

You were backing out of your driveway when a high-pitched scream reverberated through your neighborhood. You hit the brakes, and the source of the scream, a blond girl around age 10 with a pageboy haircut, appears in your rearview mirror. You put the car in park and hop out. The girl is crouched down near the back of your car. You see traces of fur and blood.

"You backed over my puppy!" the girl cries.

"Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry," you say.

"He was just chasing a ball, and you ran over him!" she says.

"I'm so so sorry, I didn't see him. This is awful, I'm so sorry," you say. 

"How. Could. You." The blond girl's pupils glow a deep red, and you realize too late that you really, really should have checked your mirrors.
