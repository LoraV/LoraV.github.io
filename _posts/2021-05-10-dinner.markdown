Today's prompt: "An argument at Sunday dinner"

"Well, I don't know why everyone talks about how difficult fugu is to prepare," your dad says. "One of the easier dishes I've made."

"What?" you say. "Dad, how was this fish sourced?"

"You and your namby-pamby farm-to-table whosawhatsits," your dad says. "Just eat the fish."

"I already ate some. That's what I'm worried about. Did you make sure this is farm-raised fugu that isn't poisonous?"

"I'm sure they wouldn't sell it if it was poisonous."

"You can't be too careful about these kinds of things!"

Your mom sighs. "Can't you just enjoy your father's cooking without making a big deal out of everything?"
