Today's prompt: "Write a life as a series of postcards."

![Greetings from Arizona]({{site.baseurl}}/public/postcard1.png)

Hello Pen Pal! Mom and Dad and my brother and sister and I are on a road trip to Santa Fe to visit Grandma. Dad said we should stop at Bedrock City. There were dinosaur statues and a volcano and a dinosaur slide. Dad said I should go down the slide, but the slide wasn't very fast and I had to pull myself down the slidewith my hands on the rail but then I just stood up because I was close to the ground. There was also a giant pair of teeth in the dentist's office there. It was kind of scary.

Hello Pen Pal! I hope you enjoyed your visit to Santa Fe. Alas, I am stuck here in R'lyeh. I would be very curious indeed to see the giant teeth in Bedrock City. I wonder if they are anywhere near as large as my friend Sebek's? He has a crocodile head, and very sharp teeth. Pretty scary!

Hello Pen Pal! How are things in R'lyeh? I just finished unpacking in my dorm room at New York University. It didn't feel like a proper trip until I'd written to you, though. I'm so excited to start film school! My first semester is going to mostly core requirements, but that's okay. I already have an idea for my first student film. It's about a woman whose best friend is a werewolf, but she doesn't know it even though all her other friends keep getting mauled to death. What do you think?

Hello Pen Pal! Congratulations on getting into NYU. I hear the film school is very prestigious. Things in R'lyeh are as non-Euclidean as ever. I think your film idea has legs, but may I make a small suggestion? Werewolves are pass√©. Tentacle-mouthed creatures with bat wings are where it's at.

Hello Pen Pal! I'm here in Costa Rica with my girlfriend of 3 years, Erin. Can you keep a secret? I'm going to propose. I've only told a couple close friends so far, but somehow I feel like I need to tell you. I've been corresponding with you for so long, and yet we've never met. But I can't ever seem to go on vacation without writing to you. Plus I love those postcards you send. They're so unusual. I'll probably be back home by the time you get this. If you're ever in the Boston area, look me up.

Hello Pen Pal! Wouldn't you know it, I made it up to Boston. I took you up on your invitation and looked you up. I'm dropping this postcard I brought with me off in your mailbox personally. I hope you don't mind if I swing by tonight for dinner.
