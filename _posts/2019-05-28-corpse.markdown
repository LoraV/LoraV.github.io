Today's prompt: "The corpse you saw in the undertaker's window"

The undertakers did their best, but the body has a distinctly gnawed-on appearance. 

You always thought these eldritch gods swallowed people whole, or at least would have finished their meals. Perhaps Aiueb Gnshal is a picky eater.

A week later, and a new casket appears. New corpse, similar bite marks. You pass by the window, thinking that this is a very strange way of advertising one's services. People don't tend to go window shopping for funeral gear. 

A few days later, you open your front door to a massive set of teeth.
