Today's prompt: "Write a 'knock knock' joke. Then use it in a story."

"Knock knock," says the loud, deep, malevolent voice at your door.

"Who's there?" you ask.

"Hziulquoigmnzhah."

"Hizzy-quig-munch-whatnow?"

Your door is ripped off its hinges by an Old One that looks like a squat, fat, combination toad-bat-sloth thing with a long neck, long forearms and dozens of short, stubby legs.

"You fucked up my name and my joke!" he screams.
