Today's prompt: "Describe your favorite athlete"

When it comes to baseball, most people will root for the home team, but if the home team's not playing, they come up with other criteria for who they'll root for. A lot of folks love an underdog. The Cubs, for instance -- they went 71 years without winning a World Series, which was a record until they finally won it in 2016, and then the Cleveland Burning Rivers (formerly the Cleveland Indians, back before the state of Washington, city of Atlanta and city of Cleveland all finally figured out their franchise names were kind of inappropriate) surpassed that dry spell, going 89 years without a World Series win.

Other folks would rather cheer on the winning side, and that's why you're a Yankees fan. [Harold George Steinbrenner III](https://yuhdead.com/death/scenes/2019/03/19/yankees-todo/) put together the best team money could buy, including your favorite player, Alex Rodriguez IV (aka A-Rod Quatro). Rumored to be the descendant of Alex Rodriguez and a vat of human growth hormone, A-Rod Quatro was the youngest player to ever hit 750 home runs, and one season his slugging percentage was .748. Needless to say, the man is good with a bat, which you found out the hard way when you were a little too insistent on an autograph one day after a game and the temperamental ball player pulverized you with a Louisville Slugger.
