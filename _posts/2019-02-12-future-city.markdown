Today's prompt: "Your city one hundred years from now"

The future has no time for the dead.

The cemetery where your remains were interred was moved twice, first to make room for highrises and an IRL Pok√©mon Go gym, then to make room for even higher highrises and a Mensa Bar where you can get the latest chip implant. The third time, they didn't really bother to move you. They just disinterred your remains as they dug the foundations, and put your bones and your worn headstone -- -2019 still visible amid the mud and spray paint -- on Garbage Island, the world's fastest-growing land mass.
