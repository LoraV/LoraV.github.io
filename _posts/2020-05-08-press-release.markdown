Tacos Del R'lyeh Debuts New Human Meat Menu

The all-new menu of craveable tacos, tostadas, burritos and crunchwraps is made with 100% fresh ground or shredded human

R'lyeh, South Pacific (May 8, 2020) -- Tacos Del R'lyeh is treating its fans to an all-new menu sensation with tacos, burritos, gorditas and quesadillas made from premium human meat. Now in addition to enjoying their favorite items with chicken, beef, bean and steak, Old Ones can try out the entire Tacos Del R'lyeh line with succulent human meat. Human meat comes either ground or shredded and is spiced to perfection in true Tacos Del R'lyeh style.

"This bold new selection of human meat menu items completely transforms the Tacos Del R'lyeh menu into something we're sure fans will love even more than ever before," said Gleen, The Corrupter of Flesh, Tacos Del R'lyeh's Senior Vice President of Research and Development. 

"At Tacos Del R'lyeh, we believe in sharing the stories behind our food. For example, this chalupa was made from a human named [insert-your-name-here], who was harvested fresh from their house this morning while pulling weeds in their front yard and singing 'Margaritaville,'" Gleen said, taking a big bite of the crunchily-wrapped, decadently cheesy chalupa.

Sure to become a hit among Great Old Ones, Outer Gods and shoggoths alike, human-meat tacos and burritos were first introduced in the original R'lyeh branch of Tacos Del R'lyeh, but they are rolling out worldwide later this month.
