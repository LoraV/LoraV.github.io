Today's prompt: "Everyone was laughing, except you."

"Hold my beer," you said, passing your Natty Light to Doug. You stepped into the water skis and grabbed the bungee cord attached to Bruce's pickup truck with your left hand and your firearm in your right hand. Bruce put the truck into four-wheel drive. The tires spun in the muddy dirt lot, plastering your torso and chin with earth splatters. "Waahoo!" you shouted as the truck shuddered forward. The bungee cord stretched out, and then your skis scraped along gravel and dirt and puddles. You fired your gun in the air as the truck picked up speed.

Bruce turned onto the street and you leaned into the 90-degree turn, but you weren't going fast enough to maintain your balance that way. "Speed up!" you shouted to Bruce, but it was too late. You fell on your side into the street. 

Bruce heard you, though, and put it in gear and gunned it. Your buddies ran into the street, cheering and laughing and chasing you. The bungee cord was somehow wrapped around your hand. You couldn't let go. You were dragged behind the Toyota Tundra for three blocks before Bruce looked in the rearview mirror and couldn't see you. He slammed on the brake, and that's when the bungee cord snapped back, smashing you into the tailgate and killing you instantly.

You gotta admit. It was kind of funny.
