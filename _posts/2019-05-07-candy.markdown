Today's prompt: "The carpenter who brought candy"

The day before yesterday, there was a trail of saltwater taffy leading to your neighbor's workshop.

You ignored it. 

The next day, there was a trail of Jolly Ranchers leading to the workshop.

Not even worth bending over to pick up.

Today, there was a trail of Reese's peanut butter cups leading to the workshop.

Probably melty by now, but still -- yum.

You pick up one peanut butter cup after the next. As you reach for the one next to the workshop door, it creaks open. Still hunched over, you raise your eyes and see a sandbag crashing down toward your head.

You blink in and out of consciousness. Every time you wake up, you find your eyes drifting past the planes and the clamps and settling on the awls, drills, rasps, and chisels. Everything sharp glints in the low light with a particular malice -- the claws of a hammer, the teeth of a saw.

You drift off one final time, only to be awakened by the unmistakable sound of a circular saw.
