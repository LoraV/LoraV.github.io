Today's prompt: "Your face is on the evening news. Write a short news story to explain why."

"...And in News of the Weird today, local resident [insert your name here] fell into the ostrich pen at the zoo today and was promptly kicked to death. The zoo was temporarily closed while police and zoo staff took care of the body and the ostrich pen was taped off. Zookeepers are warning attendees that they should not get too close to the animal enclosures, especially the open-air ones that aren't surrounded by glass. Our station has obtained footage of the actual death, but we've deemed it a little too gruesome for us to air here. But you can see here where the ostrich pen has been marked off by police tape. The zoo provided us with the ostrich footage you're seeing now; it was taken sometime last summer. Back to you, Michelle."

"Boy, Dave, some of those baby ostriches are awful cute. I can see why someone would want to get up close and personal, but that might not be a good idea." 

"Yeah, don't be fooled by those big birds' appearance! Everyone, enjoy the zoo but stay safe."
