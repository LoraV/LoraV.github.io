Today's prompt: "Your day, hour by hour"

12:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.    
1:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.   
2:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.   
3:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.   
4:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.  
5:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.   
6:00 a.m. -- You're asleep.   
7:00 a.m. -- You wake up. You hit snooze a few times. You get up. You take a shower. You get dressed. You eat some breakfast.  
8:00 a.m. -- You take your dogs for a quick walk. You check Twitter. You log on to your work computer.  
9:00 a.m. -- You work.  
10:00 a.m. -- You work.  
11:00 a.m. -- You work for a bit. You answer a knock at the door. The person at your door is wearing a dark, hooded robe and stabs you in the chest with a silver dagger carved with rune-like symbols. They run past you into your house, and after noisily and messily searching several rooms, run back out with the out-of-print volume of spells and incantations for communicating with the Great Old Ones that you've been researching in your spare time.
