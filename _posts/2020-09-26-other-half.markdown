Today's prompt: "How the other half lives"

The other half lives in a parallel antimatter universe, where positrons and antiprotons make up not only antihydrogen and antihelium, but anti-daffodils, anti-chihuahuas and anti-Cool-Ranch-Doritos.

Maybe that sounds implausible, given that particle accelerators have only succeeded in making miniscule amounts of antiparticles a day, and only a handful of those have survived cosmic rays and radioactive decay and have formed anti-atoms. But that's the thing about the multiverse. An infinite number of universes makes the implausible not only possible, but, somewhere, a reality. Kind of like how the Marvel Universe has Earth-200500, which is just like the normal Earth-616 in the Marvel Universe except all the Avengers have beards, including Scarlet Witch.

In that antimatter universe, antimatter you is relaxing with an antimatter beer after a long day of pulling antimatter weeds, washing antimatter dishes, and folding antimatter laundry, when a wormhole opens up and propels them across the multiverse and right into regular-matter you.
