Today's prompt: "Write a letter from the point of view of a drug addict."

Dear J,

I know you kept telling me I needed to quit. At least to cut back. That the cravings might never go away, but they would lessen eventually if I just stuck with it. And I kept telling you that I don't have a problem, I just use this to focus, and I can quit anytime I want. 

Well, I wanted to let you know, I took a big dose earlier, and suddenly everything is clear. There's no pain. No craving. Complete and total focus. The way I feel right now, I feel like I may never have to use again. I feel serene. At peace. My soul feels free.

I just wish someone would tell me why my body is over there.

Sincerely,   
[Insert-your-name-here]
