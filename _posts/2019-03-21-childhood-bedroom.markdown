Today's prompt: "Three objects in your childhood bedroom"

Your parents raised you to be a good cultist. You had a plushie Cthulhu, a "See Cthuhu Devour" board book, and a pop-up book version of the Necronomicon. And it's true, you rebelled when you became a teenager -- even threatened to become an Episcopalian a few times -- but they'd be so proud to see you now: dutifully marching toward Cthulhu in line with the other cultists, head held high, eager to be devoured first as is your right for helping bring him into this world.
