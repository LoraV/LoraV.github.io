You're a bit peckish. You go downstairs for a snack. You pour yourself a bowl of your favorite cereal, Kellogg's Shredded Krumbles (an actual cereal from the '20s. That's "Krumbles," with a "K").

You're enjoying a spoonful when a Cthulhu larva bursts from your chest. Oh man.

You should have expected this after being attacked by that facehugger Cthulhu.
