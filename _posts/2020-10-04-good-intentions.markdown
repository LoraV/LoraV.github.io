Today's prompt: "A road to hell paved with good intentions"

You were helping your friend move when you threw your back out while improperly lifting a box.

You tried to trip up a purse snatcher who was running past you, and that's how your lower right leg got all banged up.

You were folding donations to a charity-run thrift shop when a hobo spider dropped out of an old shirt and bit you on your toe, which swelled up.

And that's why you were in no way able to run fast enough to escape the werewolf pack.
