Today's prompt: "A beginner's guide to skipping out of work"

1. Call into work. Fake a croaky voice. Cough a lot. Say you're not feeling well and you need to stay home.
2. Facepalm when the HR-bot reminds you that you're working remotely anyway.
3. Tell the HR-bot that the internet is out at your house so you can't do any work.
4. Wait on hold while the HR-bot gets the IT-bot on the call.
5. Feign surprise when the IT-bot informs you that it has diagnosed your internet connection remotely and it is working perfectly well. 
6. Feign poor cell reception.
7. Hang up the phone.
8. Run. 
9. Realize, too late, that you should have left your phone at home because the productivity-bots can use it to track you.
10. Die from laser blasts, a warning to other would-be truants.
