Today's prompt: "What people don't understand about you"

"Ugh, they never text me back anymore. I don't know why they have to be so rude," Kayla says. "You don't have to ghost on me. You can just say if you're not interested or you're busy."

"They're just lazy," your mom says. "All they want to do anymore is lie around."

"Man, they're just no fun anymore," your friend Jay says. "I saw them in a park, and I threw a frisbee to them, and they didn't even try to catch it. They just laid there on the ground."

"Wow, they have like, no sense of personal hygiene," Allison says. "When I last saw them, there were like all these maggots crawling all over them. Gross. It's like they've given up on life."
