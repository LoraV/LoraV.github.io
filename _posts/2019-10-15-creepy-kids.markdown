Today's prompt: "A vivid childhood memory from the child's perspective"

Adults just don't get us. They call us creepy just because we make sacrifices to the corn god or we crawl out of TV screens or or we stare at you with our glowing eyes. They never understand our fascination with knives and setting things on fire. Speaking of which, do you think Mommy would be more mad about your bloodstains on the rug, or if I just burned your body and the rug?

Hmmm. I'll go get the matches, just in case.
