Today's prompt: "Describe an experience from the point of view of someone who is phobic about that very experience. For example, an airplane flight taaken by someone terrified of flying, an agorophobic lost in a pasture, an arachibutyrophobic eating a sandwich."

Their gruesome pasty-white pancake makeup, their exaggerated red lips (the big big mouths to eat you up with), their monstrous shoes clop-clop-clopping toward you, their hideous laughter -- all of that would have been horrifying enough were the carfull of clowns not marching toward you with nooses in their hands.
