Today's prompt: "Your first time in a foreign country"

The first time you went to Mexico, you went to Tijuana. You remember tequila, and some fish tacos, and puking up the fish tacos, and getting the bed spins.

The second time you went to Mexico, you went to Oaxaca. You visited an old monastery, the Templo de Santo Domingo; an archeological museum, the Museo de sitio do Monte Albán; and the gardens at Jardín Etnobotánico de Oaxaca. The highlight was a pastelería near Mercado Benito Juárez where you bought a pastry in the shape of a swan. It was delicious.

You were really looking forward to snorkeling and checking out the Frida Kahlo meusem at Playa del Carmen, but your plane was hijacked by cultists and you were flown to R'lyeh to be dinner for the Old Ones.
