Today's prompt: "Five things you see out the nearest window"

A cow. Another cow. A third cow. Yet another cow. A really angry cow.

An entire herd of cows is stampeding toward your home, oblivious to the injury they will do to themselves crashing into it. You watch wide-eyed as a bull lowers his horns and aims himself squarely for your French doors. The glass shatters, the window sashing flies apart, and suddenly the whole herd is pouring in through the broken doors. Cows are defecating on your carpet, toppling your furniture (including, ironically, the china hutch), and trampling you under their powerful hooves.
