Today's prompt: "The last time you changed your mind about something important"

It's just turned 12 o'clock. You close your spreadsheets, stand up from your desk, adjust the collar of the white button-down shirt you always wear, and head to the fridge, where you retrieve a Kraft Singles-and-mayonnaise sandwich on Wonder Bread, a Red Delicious apple, a baggie of baby carrots and exactly four Chips Ahoy cookies. Your normal lunch.

But today it tastes like ash in your mouth. Like boredom. Like wasted potential.

"Enough of this sameness, day in and day out!" you shout, hurling your lunch in the trash. There! Same old lunch, gone. 

You can't do much about your same old wardrobe right now, but you defiantly untuck your shirt. There. Better. 

Just then, your boss rounds the corner. Before they can even say hello to you, you stride up to them and loudly inform them, "I quit! I'm going to go off adventuring!"

"O....kaaaaayyyy," they respond. But you're already on your way out the door. 

Five weeks later, your makeshift armor constructed from aluminum pie tins is just not standing up to the beating you're taking from the pack of ogres you recklessly charged.
