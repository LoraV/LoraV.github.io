Today's prompt: "Something you lost"

Are you familiar with the Marvel villain Arcade? He creates these massive deathtraps, typically with an amusement park theme. He's included giant, deadly pinball machines; giant, deadly carousels; giant, deadly mazes; and robot hockey players. He calls it "Murderworld." He intentionally crafts his deathtraps so there's always a chance you can escape, but your odds may be very low.

The witch seated before you must be a fan. And like any good villain, she's monologuing. 

"That draining feeling you're experiencing is the feeling of having your life stolen away. Sucked out. I'm a Life Absorber. I can pull a person's life out of them, all but the last minute of it, and trap it in an object of my choosing. They can reabsorb their life if they can find and destroy the object within that remaining 60 seconds.

"I've chosen to place your life in this ordinary blue plastic ball," she says. "Simple to destroy. Just stab it with this pocketknife." She tosses you a Swiss Army Knife. "All you have to do is find the ball," she says, tossing it into a giant ball pit filled with identical ordinary blue plastic balls.

"Good luck finding it," she calls over her shoulder as she strides out of the room. "Clock's ticking."
