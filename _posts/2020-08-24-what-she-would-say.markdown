Today's prompt: "Just when I thought I knew what she'd say next..."

Orc blood smears your cheeks. Kraken viscera drips from your calves. And your tunic is stained with gelatinous cube...gelatin.

It's been a day.

But there she is, chained to the cliff, blonde hair billowing around her tattered raiments. A damsel in distress.

You stroll toward her, the soles of your fur-lined boots echoing through the cavern. 

She pries open heavy eyelids. "You didn't have to come here," she says.

"I know," you say, lowering the sword you had been aiming at her chains, and pressing your palm against her chin. "But fighting for the freedom of others is its own reward. Especially when fighting for the freedom of such a lovely young maiden as yourself."

"No," she said, and suddenly her chains uncoil from the ceiling, transform into tentacles, and in a few deft moves disarm and suffocate you. "I mean I wasn't even hungry yet."
