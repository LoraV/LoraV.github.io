Today' prompt: "Write from the point of view of a literary character who changed your life."

Oh no. I petted you too hard. You was so soft, and I petted you too hard.

"Why do you got to get killed? You ain't so little as mice. I didn't bounce you hard." I tilt your little face up so's I can look at it. Oh no. What about the rabbits? "Now maybe George ain't gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin's out you got killed."

I gots to hide you. I'll bury you under the hay. Scoop out a little hole. But what if someone fin's you anyways? What if someone asks where you is? Am I in bad trouble? No. Not bad trouble. "This ain't no bad thing like I got to go hide in the brush. Oh! no. This ain't. I'll tell George I foun' it dead."

George is too smart to b'lieve that. "But he'll know. George always knows. He'll say, 'You done it. Don't try to put nothing over on me.' An' he'll say, 'Now jus' for that you don't get to tend no rabbits!'"

And that's your fault, for bein' dead! "God damn you. Why do you got to get killed? You ain't so little as mice." I throw your body away, an' I sit all curled up, an' I rock. "Now I won't get to tend the rabbits. Now he won't let me."

I wisht, I wisht that puppy wasn't dead. That soft soft pup. I pick you up and I pet you again. "You wasn't big enough. They tol' me and tol' me you wasn't. I di'n't know you'd get killed so easy."
