Today's prompt: "Write a script to give telemarketers to solicit donations for starving children in Africa."

Hello sir or madam,

Have you ever considered what it's like to die of starvation? I don't know firsthand, but I do know secondhand, because they keep a cage of emaciated people here in the cube farm, so we can describe what we see to you. There's like three of them in there now -- there's one woman with a fitted top, and you can literally count her ribs through it. There's another fella who keeps staring at my sandwich, but the bosses won't let us feed them. Sorry, dude, no pastrami for you. And there's a third individual -- looks like they have a name badge on? It says [insert your name here]. Huh. Wonder where they get the people for the cage. All of them are just skin and bones, and they all look absolutely miserable. Well, maybe not [insert your name here] as much -- skin and bones, yes, but maybe not as miserable as the other two. There's kind of a weird faraway look in their eyes. Anyway, there's only three people in this cage, but in Africa, there's a whole continent of them! Little kids, starving to death, their arms unnaturally thin, their torsos downright skeletal, their skin stretching concavely out toward the edges of their pelvic bones. Won't you give $20 today to help save the lives of starving children?

Oh! [Insert your name here] just fell to the ground. I'm not sure if they fainted from hunger again, or if they -- oh, nope, dead. Looks like security's coming to take the body away. They like to do that before the other people in the cage can cannibalize them.
