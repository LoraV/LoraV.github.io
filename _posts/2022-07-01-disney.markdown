Every light casts a shadow. Every rose has its thorn. Even the happiest place on earth has its dark side. Did you know there's a Disney jail? For reals? There's a holding cell for guests who get a little too assault-y or a little too shoplift-y or a little too drunk.

Likewise, every cloud has a silver lining; every darkness, its dawn. Make no mistake, you're in a very, very bad place, and you're not getting out alive. But that doesn't mean you can't have the happiest death possible.

You may never go to Disney jail. But you can go to Disney morgue.
