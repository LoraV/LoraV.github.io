Today's prompt: "Waking up elsewhere"

You went to bed in a hotel room. A nice hotel room with high thread count sheets, blackout curtains, and thick walls. You sleep soundly. 

Until you wake up in a giant belly full of stomach acid. Next time Old Ones invade the earth, you  might do well to stay away from hotels, big apartment buildings and other large congregate living facilities. They're kind of like buffets for Elder Gods.
