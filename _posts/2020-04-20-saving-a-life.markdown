Today's prompt: "How someone saved your life"

I will never forget how I was crossing the street, headphones in, oblivious to my surroundings, when suddenly a body crashed into me from behind, shoulder pressing into my back, rushing me forward, shoving me to the sidewalk. I turned my head to yell, "What the hell...." And then I saw the truck barrelling through the space I had just occupied, unable to brake. 

You got up. Extended your hand. Pulled me to my feet. Seriously, it was like out of a movie. 

I will never forget how the next truck with failing brakes launched itself onto the curb and plowed into you before I could pull you out of its path.

They finally caught the guy who'd been severing everybody's brake lines. 

I still visit your grave. I wish I'd had your reflexes.
