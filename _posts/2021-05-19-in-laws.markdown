Today's prompt: "A beginner's guide to winning over your in-laws"

1. Find out some things you have in common.
2. Experience those things together.
3. Next time, if there is a next time, try to pick something like a movie genre you all like or a hobby you share instead of your mutual inability to swim. Or if you have to pick your inability to swim, maybe experience it together by deciding to do everything together on dry land. 
4. There's not going to be a next time.
