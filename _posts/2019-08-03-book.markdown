Today's prompt: "Your favorite book"

You always enjoyed *Animal Farm,* a subversive little tome that you had to keep hidden, knowing it would not go over well in the authoritarian community of Cthulhu worshippers in which you were raised. Unfortunately, no secret stays hidden forever, and horses are not the only creatures that can be sent to a glue factory.
