Today's prompt: "The greatness of sandwiches"

Sandwiches. They're just great, aren't they? So delicious. They've got that nice little coating on the outside, but then when one bites into them, there's that wonderful red, juicy pulp. And then the crunchy bits! So good! 

Isn't it so funny how sandwiches think they're people? Ha ha, so silly, it's adorable. I mean, not cute enough for me to swear off sandwiches, obviously. I hear Lythalia is a vegan now. Crazy, right? Eh, what do you expect from a Forest Goddess? But I can't imagine never eating sandwiches again. Or people, or whatever the sandwiches are calling themselves these days.

Hey! Sandwich! Yeah, you! I'm talking to you! The gods made you with legs so you could walk into our mouths. My mouth is this way, you ridiculous biped! You're going the wrong way! Hahahahahaha I'm kidding, obviously. We didn't make you with legs so you could march right into our gaping maws. We made you with legs because it's so much fun to catch you when you run. You don't seriously think you could outrun a being 50 times your size, do you?

Om nom nom nom nom.
