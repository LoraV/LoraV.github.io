Today's prompt: "Think of a person you despise. Now describe all the wonderful things about that person."

I don't love the fact that he's eating you right now, but it is rather impressive the way Cthulhu keeps his mouth-tentacles clean and well-groomed. A lot of guys with facial hair, it's pretty common to catch them with a little beer froth or scrambled egg stuck in their beard. But Cthulhu? Not a speck of viscera on those tentacles.
