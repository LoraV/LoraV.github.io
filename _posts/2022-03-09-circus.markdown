Today's prompt: "Describe two visits to the circus from the point of view of someone who's bipolar. On one visit, he's manic, and on the other, he's in a pit of despair." (As always, feel free to disregard the gender specified in the prompt.)

OMG, you think, the circus is amazeballs! The elephants! The trapeze artists! The fire eaters! The sword swallowers! The funnel cakes! The clowns, okay I can do without the clowns, but the lion tamers! The dancing bears! The games where you have to shoot little moving targets!

OMG, you think, the circus was way more fun last time when I wasn't being trampled to death by rogue elephants.
