Today's prompt: "Write down twenty details of your neighborhood block"

The metal trash cans that clang noisily when you bump into them at night.   
The cat that yowls every time it sees you.   
The guy kitty-corner from your house who you frequently see standing by an upper story window holding a sniper rifle.   
The deciduous trees that always seem to drop their leaves all at once.   
That one house with all the bear traps out front.   
The house that never took down its Halloween decorations. You know there are ways to corpse a plastic skeleton -- to make it look like there's a bit of rotting flesh on the bones -- but these are especially realistic. Such craftsmanship!   
The house that never stopped playing that one Halloween CD with all the moans and wolf howls and clanking chains.   
The guy across the street with the chainsaw collection.   
That one guy who wears a hockey mask everywhere.   
The crow that frequently perches in one of the trees and caws loudly.   
The many wind chimes in front of bear trap house.   
The little lending library outside Halloween CD house with all the _Goosebumps_ books and that one copy of _The Anarchist Cookbook_.   
The graffiti that has appeared in the alley in a language no one recognizes.   
The red stains that keep appearing on the driveway of the house three doors down until the man who lives there hoses it off.   
The mailbox that has Hello Kitty stickers all over it.   
The stray dog that has been acting much more aggressive lately.   
Occasional sounds of a woodpecker.   
Occasional sounds of an owl.   
Occasional sounds of a jackhammer, though you don't see where anyone is doing construction.   
Your house, which you see has a newly broken window as you approach it.
