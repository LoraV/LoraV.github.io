The gaping maw of oblivion. The screams of the damned echoing from the darkness. The hot, humid breath of the all-devourer, emanating from a void ringed with sharp, yet rotting teeth. The all-consuming one's massive, muscular tongue roils in his mouth. His teeth sink into your flesh. Your hot blood spills across his taste buds. You die, horribly and painfully, your bones crunched in the giant mouth of an eldritch god.
