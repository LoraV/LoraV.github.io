Today's prompt: "Scientists announce they've discovered the secret to immortality. Write a petition letter to save the event of death." [I'm going to play with the format a bit here.]

"In our top story tonight, scientists have announced they've discovered the secret to immortality! Let's go to our correspondent Valerie at the scientists' press conference for more on this incredible news."

"Thanks, Mark. The lead researchers on this project, Dr. Vincent Singh, Dr. Madeleine Chao and Dr. [insert your name here], have just stepped up to the microphone and are about to explain what made this scientific achievement possible. Let's have a listen. Dr. [insert your name here] is about to speak."

"Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues and I are proud to announce what might be the greatest achievement in all of mankind. Previous generations invented the telephone, learned to fly, landed on the moon -- but today, we conquer death itsel--"

_Screeeeeechhhhhh._

"Just a second, Mark. A woman has just driven up alongside the stage here and gotten out of her car, shouting. She appears to be pleading with the scientists, but it's hard to tell what she's saying since she's not close to the microphone. I could be mistaken, but it sounded a little like, 'are you trying to put me out of a job?'"

"Very disturbing. Valerie, can you and the cameraman get a little closer and try to make out what she's saying? And meanwhile here at the station we'll try to find out who this woman is."

"Sure thing, Mark. The scientists appear to be utterly flabbergasted. Dr. [insert your name here] is trying to reassert control over the situation, but is having a hard time over this distraction."

"We conquer death itself, and establish a new reign of--" _Thud. Sheee-shweeeen-shhreeee._

"I don't know if our cameras were in place for that, but the woman has just shoved the podium where all the microphones were mounted and knocked it over. I can just make out what she's saying. Something about how if nothing ever dies, life will take over this world like a cancer, and the world will run out of resources. She's talking about how viruses are a form of life, and if they are exposed to this treatment, people will live forever in sickness, misery and starvation. Dr. Singh is trying to explain to her that they plan to implement strict controls over this immortality treatment and ensure it does not spread to viruses or bacteria, but the woman seems unconvinced they can prevent that."

"Valerie, we've just heard some unconfirmed reports by callers to the station that this woman is a blogger who writes -- death scenes? Did I hear that right? Okay, yes, death scenes. What a strange hobby. What's happening out there, Valerie?"

"Mark, this woman is now asking these scientists what gives them the right to determine who lives and dies. And this is a question similar to one I had hoped to ask the scientists. Presumably not everyone will be able to afford this treatment. Will it just be a matter of the rich living on into perpetuity, while the poor and destitute around them are consigned to death? Also, is this a maintenance drug that people will have to keep taking for the rest of their lives, and paying for all the while?"

"Interesting questions, Valerie. How are the scientists responding?"

"Well, Dr. Chao seems to be agreeing that this cure will likely never be available to everyone, but the scientists hope that eventually economies of scale will make it more widely available to most people, not just the super-rich. There will probably always be some issues of access, however, based on geography and economic forces."

"Valerie, it looks like the woman is walking back to her car -- is she just giving up?"

"I don't think so, Mark. She was just shouting something about knowing a way to make these scientists beg for death and -- whoa, is that a sledgehammer? Dr. Chao and Dr. Singh have bolted from the stage, but Dr. [insert your name here] seems frozen to the spot and -- we need to cut away."
