Today's prompt: "A physical description of an eccentric relative"

Aunt Mary. Always with her tight, frizzy curls, her dangling earrings, round cheeks, thick eyebrows, Coke-bottle glasses and heavy bangles. And always with those delicious funeral potatoes she brought to family gatherings. Fuzzy Aunt Mary -- that's what everyone in the family called her. It started with some of the young kids, but it caught on until everyone in the family was calling her Fuzzy Aunt Mary.

That is, until the day her Coke-bottle glasses were so fogged up with steam that she didn't even notice when her chunky bracelets knocked over an open bottle with a "Mr. Yuck" symbol right into the potatoes and the resulting casserole killed off half the extended family, including you. Now the survivors call her Poison Aunt Mary.
