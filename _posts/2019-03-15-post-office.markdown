Today's prompt: "An estranged mother and son who haven't seen or spoken to each other in more than twenty years meet in line at the post office in December, arms full of packages to be mailed. What do they say to each other?"

"Son."

"Mom."

"I see you're sending off packages to the Dark Reverend. At least you're still doing that."

"Mom. Just because I don't go to Black Sabbath every Saturday doesn't mean I'm not a Cultist."

"Well. I'm glad to see you're sticking to the old traditions."

"Yeah."

"One of your packages is leaking."

"Crap. Um. Do you have any Kleenex in your purse?"

"John, if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. You have to double-bag-and-seal your body parts, at least! Here."

"I know, I know. I'm a fuck-up."

"I didn't say it."

"You were thinking it."

"You know, your father and I got one of those vacuum sealers thingies they show on the infomercials. We can seal up whole arms now with no leaks! They're so handy, and such a good deal." 

"Mom, you know the markup on all those infomercial products is astonomical. I can go online and find them for way cheaper."

"Well, maybe you should get yourself one then, and your packages wouldn't be leaking blood all over the post office."

"What do you think he does with all of them, anyway?"

"The prophet works in mysterious ways. I'm sure whatever he's doing with them, it's helping to bring Cthulhu closer to us."

"I bet he puts most of them in the incinerator."

"John!"

"Well think about it, Mom. Hundreds of people send in sacrifices for Black Christmas each year. He'd have to be holding rituals 24/7 just to keep up."

"Maybe he freezes some of them for later in the year."

"Ugh, whatever."

"Did you get anyone off the Dark Reverend's list?"

"Actually, yeah!"

"Oh! There were only three in the area who were on the list this year! Did you get Angela Cordette? Nathan Fortham?"

"No, I got [insert your name here]."

"Son. I am so proud of you."
