Today's prompt: "My grandfather's girlfriend"

Your grandfather's girlfriend is a fascinating little old lady. You could write a whole collection of stories about her. In fact, Helene Tursten wrote a collection of stories about a woman very much like her, called "An Elderly Lady is Up to No Good."  

The trouble with you is you are a threat to your grandfather's girlfriend. You talk entirely too much about your debts. Your financial entanglements. All the things you would do if you only had money. And she's not as helpless, nor as innocent, as she looks.
