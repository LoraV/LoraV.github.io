Today's prompt: "The difference between the first death you remember and the most recent one"

The most obvious difference between the death of your guinea pig, Howard, and your own death is that you're experiencing the latter firsthand. But there were other differences. Howard went peacefully, in his sleep. You died violently, at the hands of someone you thought you could trust. Did the betrayal sting as much as the knife they put in your chest? That's not for me to say. I'm just saying, you probably envy poor little Howard right now.
