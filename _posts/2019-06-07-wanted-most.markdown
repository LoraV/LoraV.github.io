Today's prompt: "Start a story with: 'This is what she wants most in the world.'"

This is what she wants most in the world: to see her family thrive. To see her cubs grow, to teach them to fish, to show them where the best berries are. When they were born, she licked them clean and nursed them. She coaxed them to climb trees. She would do anything for them.

And you? You're standing right between her and them.
