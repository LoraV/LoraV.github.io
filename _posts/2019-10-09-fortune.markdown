Today' prompt: "Be your character's fortune teller. Tell his or her future."

Madame V's wide velvet sleeves pool around her elbows as she dramatically flutters her fingers over the crystal ball. Her painted eyelids fall heavily over her eyes as she studies the sphere.

"Your future appears ... cloudy," she says.

You sigh. "Do I need to pay another $20 for better reception?"

She shakes her head. "I'm sorry. I just can't get a good read on you. It's just cloudy."

"Did you try shaking it? Maybe turning it off and on again?"

She eyes you with annoyance, then stares at the crystal ball for a full minute. At last, she looks up. "I'm sorry. This is highly unusual. I can't see anything about your future. Just clouds."

"Whatever," you say. "I suppose I could try Psychic Friends Network."

"Are those frauds really still around?" she asks. 

"You should talk. Charging me 40 bucks to tell me my future is 'cloudy.'"

Madame V tosses two twenties across the table. "There." You pick up your money and begin to walk out. You glance behind you as you leave. Madame V is still staring at the crystal ball, her face inches from it, muttering softly, "I just don't understand..."

You walk outside and are immediately devoured by The Cloud-Thing.
