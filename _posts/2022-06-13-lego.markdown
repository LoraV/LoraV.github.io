You're tied to a table, face up, and one of them has just made an incision in your abdomen with a nasty-looking knife. They're now working as one, none-too-delicately pulling out your entrails, enthusiastically rending you apart bit by bit, organ by organ, humming all the while. One yanks out a few yards of small intestine. Another starts manhandling your kidneys. The pain is excruciating. Rather than focus on the pain, you try to focus on the humming. The tune is recognizable, but the words escape you. There's a sharp pain as they reach their hands inside you, and suddenly the lyrics are back. You can't help smiling as you mouth the words: 

_Everything is awesome   
Everything is cool when you're part of a team   
Everything is awesome   
When you're living your dream...._
