Today's prompt: "Being chased by a killer"

Your lungs are on fire. A nearby branch scrapes your left forearm. Your feet pound through the cheatgrass.

A bullet whizzes past you. Five, you think.

You jump over a log. Splash through a creek. Careen between trees.

The gun fires again. The bullet hits a tree about a foot and a half to your left. Six. Hopefully he has a standard revolver.

Your foot snags on the underbrush. You recover. You propel yourself through bushes and tall grass.

A whirling knife comes to a stop in a tree two feet to your right. Okay, he's out of ammo, but not out of weapons.

You duck beneath a low-hanging branch. Plunge into a small clearing. Charge back into the woods beyond.

A machete comes to a stop in an old oak tree just before you pass it. How many weapons does this guy have?

You swerve around the oak. Squeeze between two aspens. Your feet churn through dead leaves.

Clunk.

You fall to the forest floor as the empty revolver glances off the back of your head. You try to get up, but you hear footsteps striding up behind you.

He doesn't need weapons to kill you.
