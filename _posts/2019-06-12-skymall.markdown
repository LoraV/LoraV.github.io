Today's prompt: "What would you buy from the *SkyMall* catalog? Why?"

Oh, the things you could get on an airplane, back when *SkyMall* was still a thing! You could order a set of stairs for your dog. A beginner's saxophone kit. A spatula with a flashlight on it, so you can barbecue in the dark. But you know what you can't get on this plane, right now? A fucking *parachute.*
