Today's prompt: "After the above prompt [yesterday's prompt], try this: 'She is lying. *This* is what she wants most in the world.'"

You had just noticed some adorable bear cubs up a tree and were taking some pictures when you hear an unearthly sound coming from behind you and turn to see a she-bear. Idiot. Of course the mother would be nearby.

You might get out of this if you just get away from the cubs in time. You bolt off to the left, but the mother follows you.

There is an unsettling gleam in the eye of the she-bear as she charges toward you. An uncanny valley gleam. A gleam almost like an LED.

She isn't relenting in her pursuit of you, and she's gaining. You see a long, sturdy, sharp stick on the forest floor, and you grab for it. Maybe you can scare her off with it, or if you land a hit with it, maybe you'll dissuade her from following you, and go back to her cubs. Or maybe she'll just get that much angrier. But you don't have a lot of good options.

The bear is nearly upon you. You swing the stick at her head, grazing her eye.

Sparks shoot from the eye. And the scratch you made on her face, rather than drawing blood, merely scrapes the faux fur away from the metal exoskeleton away from the bear-shaped robot.

ROBO-BEAR IS PROGRAMMED FOR CARNAGE. ROBO-BEAR CARES NAUGHT FOR FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS. ROBO-BEAR WANTS ONLY CARNAGE. *THIS* IS WHAT SHE WANTS MOST IN THE WORLD.
