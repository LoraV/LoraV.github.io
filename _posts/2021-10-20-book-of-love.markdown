Today's prompt: "Who wrote the Book of Love? Why, and what's in it?"

I'm not sure who wrote the Book of Love, but I'm pretty sure it has Fabio on the cover and was written because there's good money in romance novels.

I'm also not sure who wrote the mistaken shipping manifest. I just know that it resulted in 80 pallets of insecurely packaged black widow spiders being delivered to your house.
