Today's prompt: "Another drunken episode"

Have you ever seen the Jackie Chan movie _Drunken Master_? He gets drunk and performs incredible martial arts? You're kind of like that. Only the reverse. You got drunk, and all of a sudden people started attacking you, and what did you do? Why, you were utterly incompetent in that fight. When you attempted a flying kick, you landed on your ass. Your tiger claw only succeeded in overturning a half-empty bottle of whisky. And you managed to head-fu a wall. Your attackers' martial arts style, on the other hand, is quite deadly.
