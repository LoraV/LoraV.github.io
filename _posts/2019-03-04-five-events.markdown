Today's prompt: "List five cultural events that impacted you greatly. Then write about one of them without mentioning yourself."

1. Othuyeg, the Doom-Walker (a giant eyeball), lands a reality show following the release of its sex tape.
2. Congressional hearings on the cultist menace. It was the '93 senate hearings on violent video games all over again.
3. Miley Cyrus comes out as a member of the Cult of the Skull.
4. The Internet explodes about whether the spokesperson for the Black Brotherhood said "Yog-Sapha" (the Dweller of the Depths) or "Ythogtha" (the Thing in the Pit) was coming to devour us all. It was Yanny and Laurel all over again.
5. Mormo, the Thousand-Faced Moon, makes her first big appearance at Coachella.
 
Mormo was amazing! ~~You~~ everyone at the festival was wowed by what she was wearing. First, she comes out in her vampire woman form, in this billowy black lace number, and then she switched to this bright red dress with a slit up the side, and then giant bright red sequined bat wings burst out of the back of it! And then she changed into a gorgon! So awesome! And then she turned into a mischief of white rats! ~~You didn't even know~~ I bet a lot of people didn't even know a group of rats was called a mischief until then! And then she turned into a levitating yellow spiral! And then she turned into a hunched albino toad-thing with feelers instead of a face! And then all her servitors came out, looking the exact same way! And then she ate ~~you~~ a lot of people!
