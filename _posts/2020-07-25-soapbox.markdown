Today's prompt: "A person is standing on a soapbox in the park, yelling at passersby. What's going on?"

You yell and you yell to everyone in hearing distance at the park that, according to the ancient prophecy you've just translated, we have a week to close the interdimensional rift in the Marianas Trench before the Old Ones awake, come through it, and devour all of humanity. Unfortunately, no one heeds your entirely accurate predictions, probably because they're drowned out by all the other warnings being shouted out by other people standing astride soapboxes in the park and inveighing against the dangers of space aliens, 5G networks, and Grimace from McDonaldland.
