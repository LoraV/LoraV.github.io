Today's prompt: "Your friend calls to say she saw you in the back of a police car yesterday. What happened?"

The arresting officer was one of the Xrathgul demons that have overtaken our planet. You were arrested for walking while human. You made the mistake of attempting to talk the cop out of the arrest while making a gesture that most humans would interpret as conciliatory, but most Xrathgul demons consider offensive. Resisting arrest is a capital crime in our new regime. I'm afraid your friend had to leave a message.
