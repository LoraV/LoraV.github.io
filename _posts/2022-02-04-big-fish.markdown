Today's prompt: "Write a love letter to the one who got away."

To the one that got away,

Snapper of lines, toppler of ships ... may I call you leviathan? You rose from the water, enormous, sunlight reflecting blindingly off your scales, infecting my eyes with a madness of rainbows. You could have swallowed me whole, and I would not have missed the open air. You overturned our ship, drowning the rest of the crew -- Kat, Hakim, [insert your name here] -- and I find myself unable to mourn their memories without your colossal frame looming over them and turning grief to reverie. I am your Jonah, your Pinocchio. Devour me, I am yours.
