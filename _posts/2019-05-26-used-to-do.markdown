Today's prompt: "What you used to do that you don't do anymore"

Go on road trips. Admire the creamsicle hues of a sunset. Drink a beer while trimming the trees in the front yard. Feel the wind against the side of your face. Scratch behind the ears of dogs as their owners walk them past you. Obsess about *Game of Thrones*. Make plans with friends for game nights or brunch. Look forward to the reintroduction of Count Chocula around Halloween. Ignore the warning signs when all of your neighbors started wearing black robes and carrying sharp implements. Breathe.
