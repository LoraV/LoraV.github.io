Today's prompt: "Your favorite recipe"

I've got this great beef stew recipe. Nice and thick. Potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, peas, red wine, beef broth, and a little thyme and rosemary. It's one of those recipes that's pretty friendly to substitutions. I've made it with lamb before, used parsnips when I had them, even swapped out the wine for Guinness.

Two days ago, I found your thumb in my yard. I put it in a wet paper towel in a plastic bag in my fridge in case anybody came looking for it.

Yesterday, your calf and ankle showed up next to my mailbox (sans foot). Not sure what to do, I wrapped it up and put it in the fridge as well, in a large freezer bag.

Today it was your ear and a section of your cheek, and I know, I know I shouldn't, but I'm thinking about that recipe again. It's just so versatile, and it seems like it'd be a waste not to use the meat.
