Today's prompt: "Describe a trip to an amusement park, focusing on the colors, sounds, smells, and tastes of the day."

Vaporous cotton candy melts into your tongue, followed by the warm cinnamon-sugar of churros. Pastel carousel horses blur past your vision. As you pass the roller coasters, your senses are overwhelmed by the scent of sun-warmed vomit and the delighted screams of fair-goers as they charge down the tracks.

Of course, you had to go on the haunted ride. The one with all the creepy clown heads and the caution tape and the fake cottony spiderwebs and the soundtrack of creaky doors and echoing footsteps. But something went wrong during the ride, and when the knock-off mechanical Freddy Krueger jumped out at you, his clawed hand impaled your chest. Now the only thing you can sense is the coppery taste of your own blood in your mouth and the raspy sound of your dying breath.
