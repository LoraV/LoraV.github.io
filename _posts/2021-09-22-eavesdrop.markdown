Today's prompt: "Eavesdrop today -- on the bus, in line for lunch, or on the street. What do people say? What do they really sound like?"

Killer 1, who is currently approaching your house: So what do you think this guy did, anyway?

Killer 2, who is also currently approaching your house: I don't know. Ain't my business. 

Killer 1: You ain't curious?

Killer 2: I ain't paid to be curious, and you ain't paid to ask questions.

Killer 1: Okay. 

Killer 2: Asking questions is how you get on the boss's shit list.

Killer 1: Okay! (Brief pause.) You sure this is the right house?

Killer 2: He wrote down the address. (Digs in his pocket for a scrap of paper; presents it to Killer 1.)

Killer 1: Is that a 1 or a 7?

Killer 2: That's a 7. 

Killer 1: His 1's look like 7's to me. 

Killer 2: It's clearly a 7.

Killer 1: Why don't we give him a call, make sure we're right?

Killer 2: Do you want to bother him at this hour?

Killer 1: ... No.

Killer 2: Do you want to explain to him that this asshole he's been chasing from safehouse to safehouse for months got away because you wanted to look up the address?

Killer 1: ... No. 

Killer 2: Then get your fucking gun out. We're here.
