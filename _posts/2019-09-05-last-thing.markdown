Today's prompt: "The last thing you'd want to do"

Your answer to this question has varied quite a bit over time. Kiss someone gross during spin-the-bottle. Spend another week in that toxic, soul-sucking office. Have to put down the family dog. All of those answers are melting away as a slimy, muscular tongue shoves you toward several rows of sharp teeth, and you know that being eaten by Xinlurgash the Ever-Consuming is the last thing you'd want to do.
