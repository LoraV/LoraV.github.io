Today's prompt: "You've just realized that you've lost something valuable in a nightclub (a necklace, a wallet, a phone). What happens next?"

You lost your sense that the world is a normal place where people are generally good to each other, and your surroundings can be defined by the laws of physics and Euclidian geometry, and humans are at the top of the food chain, when a group of cultists rushed into the nightclub, stabbed the bouncer and several customers, and opened up a portal to another dimension that hungry, reality-distorting elder gods began streaming through.

After that, you lost your life, but that kind of goes without saying.
