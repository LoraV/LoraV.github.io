Today's prompt: "Name the trees that stood in the neighborhood where you grew up."

The cherry tree in your old backyard? That's Kat. The maple in your neighbor's front yard? Henry. The sycamore a couple houses down? Jerry. The horse chestnut across the street? Beth. 

And the giant oak your body is swinging from on a noose? That's Kevin.
