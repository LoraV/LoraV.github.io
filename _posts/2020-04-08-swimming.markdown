Today's prompt: "Your character is swimming in a lake, not wearing her glasses. She squints at a shape coming toward her in the water. What does she think she sees?" [As usual, modifying to be gender neutral. Also modifying to be the ocean rather than a lake.]

What is that? A whale? 

A whale with a mouthful of long strands of kelp?

A whale with a cephalopod balanced on its snout, its tentacles streaming toward you?

A whale with a cephalopod on its snout and the evilest yellow eyes you've ever seen?

A whale with a cephalopod on its snout and evil yellow eyes and claws and teeth that are unnecessarily sharp for plankton?
