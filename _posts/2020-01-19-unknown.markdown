Today's prompt: "Alfred Hitchcock said that a mystery is not knowing what will happen to a bunch of guys playing poker; suspence is when only you know there's a bomb underneath the poker table. Write about a banal event, but start by introducing something that will change everything and that only the reader knows is coming."

You lift your coat from the hook. Pull your right arm into its lined sleeve, then jostle the coat until your left hand finds the other opening. Adjust the coat over your shoulders and button it down.

_the deep the dark_

You reach for the roll of plastic bags in the junk drawer and tuck them into your coat pocket. You pick up the leash. Daisy tamps her paws in excitement.

_the creeping dark_

You fasten the hook to Daisy's collar. She rushes to the door and whines in anticipation.

_unseen it comes from the shadows_

You open the door and step into gleaming sunlight. Daisy struggles at the end of the leash, stretching the muscles in your arm.

_unseen it lurks unseen it seeps it roils it billows_ 

Daisy reaches the sidewalk and turn right to follow your regular path.

_far from its realm it hastens its speed riding the wind_

Nose to the ground, Daisy sniffs the edge of the neighbor's yard, thoroughly, meditatively, then squats to pee in the grass.

_tendrils feelers reach out like fingers grasping at worlds beyond its own_

And as if she'd never paused, she's off again, straining at the leash.

_the deep the dark the creeping unknown_

You traverse your familiar neighborhood. The house with the yellow arched door. The house with the overgrown front yard. The house with vines creeping up the chimney. The house with the plum tree.

_it ripples the surface of a lake it burrows underground_

Daisy stops tugging and wanders onto a plush green lawn. You tear a platic bag off the roll, lick your thumb and forefinger and rub them against the bag's edge to open it.

_it winds itself into root systems it spreads into leaves into bark into cattails along the riverbank into blades of grass it is everywhere_

You scoop up the dog poop and knot the end of the bag. Daisy is already yanking her way forward. You keep walking. Two more blocks, then you'll turn back.

_and now it coalesces it pools it shifts all its cold dark being into a black something in needly boughs_

You duck your head as Daisy propels you along below the giant spruce.

_with darkness with screeching it floods from its hidden perch it swarms around warm flesh it buzzes with hunger it seethes with malicious joy it is the unknown devourer it leaves nothing behind and then sated it melts back into the trees into the roots into the ground into its own realm_

Daisy runs off, her leash attached to nothing.
