Today's prompt: "A man giving a speech to a crowd of thousands is suddenly caught in a bald-faced lie." [I'm going to avoid the gendered language here.]

"My fellow citizens," you address your constituents. "There are those who seek to terrorize us. They wish to control us through unfounded fears. To weaken us through rumors and innuendos. But the fact is, there is no monster hiding under the bed. There is no big bad wolf. There is no dread lord Cthulhu coming to devour us all--"

"You lie!" a man in a black robe and hood shouts and points at you. Then points at the sky above you.

Inky black clouds have congregated overhead, and they swiftly part, allowing through a long tentacle that snatches you from your podium.
