Today's prompt: "Ten euphemisms for sex" [Let's make it 15. I came up with a handful before I came up with the idea of looking at the [epithets of the Great Old Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos_deities#Table_of_Great_Old_Ones) for ideas.]

Too drunk to come up with a cute [pickup line](https://yuhdead.com/death/scenes/2021/02/05/pickup-lines/), and too horny to leave well enough alone? Feel free to use one of these on that attractive stranger, and then pay the consequences when it turns out they need to make a sacrifice to the Old Ones:

1. They say a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. Would a little bit of carnal knowledge be an even more dangerous thing?
2. Wanna play hide the tentacle?
3. Did you know the French term "la petite mort," or "the little death," refers to an orgasm? What I'm saying is, I'd let you kill me.
4. Are you a worshipper of Dhumin? Because I'd let you burrow in my bluff.
5. I'd like to make the beast with two backs, eight fangs, and three deadly stingers with you.
6. Are you a worshipper of Gloon? Because I'd let you corrupt my flesh.
7. I'd love to get to know you in the Biblical sense, because I've been smitten, also in the Biblical sense. 
8. Are you a worshipper of Lexur'iga-serr'roth? Because I'd let you devour me in the dark.
9. Are you a worshipper of Nyaghoggua? Because I'd like to have your Kraken within me.
10. Could you turn me into a skeleton? I'd really like to bone.
11. Are you a worshipper of Sho-Gath? Because I'd really like your god in my box.
12. Are you a worshipper of Sho-Gath? Because I'd really like to check out your big black thing.
13. Are you a worshipper of Y'golonac? Because I'd let you defile me any time.
14. Are you a worhipper of Bugg-Shash? Because I'd let you fill my space.
15. Are you a worhipper of Bugg-Shash? Because I'd like to make you come in the dark.
