Today's prompt: "A woman is struggling to get a large package into the trunk of her car. Her son doesn't get out of the car to help her. Write the scene." [Ignoring the gender in the prompt as usual.]

"How does he not see that I could use a little help here?" you think as you again adjust your grasp on the large, unevenly packed box before the far right corner nearly crashes into your taillight. Your biceps strain and you focus on redistributing your grip around the box to make your fourth attempt at shoving it in the trunk.

"How do they not see that knife-wielding maniac sneaking up behind them?" your son thinks, too terrified to move or speak.
