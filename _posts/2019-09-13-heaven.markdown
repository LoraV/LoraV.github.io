Today's prompt: "Describe Heaven"

Ooh, baby, don't you say I'm a liar!

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh

They say in heaven you'll get devoured

Cthulhu will take us all to R'lyeh

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh

---

When the night falls down

The cultists summon the Old Ones to town

And the world's alive with the sound

Of rending flesh and gnashing teeth

---

When Cthulhu looms above

He pulls you close with his tentacles

And you're a victim of the Call

As you lose your life, your love, your all

---

Ooh, baby, don't you say I'm a liar!

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh

They say in heaven you'll get devoured

Cthulhu will take us all to R'lyeh

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh

---

When you think you're safe,

He'll reach for you with his sharpened claws

You cannot escape 

You're enveloped in his gaping maw

---

Our world has filled with fear and tension

And horrors beyond this dimension

You have lived your whole life through

And a gruesome end has come for you

---

Ooh, baby, don't you say I'm a liar!

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh

They say in heaven you'll get devoured

Cthulhu will take us all to R'lyeh

Ooh, heaven is a place in R'lyeh
