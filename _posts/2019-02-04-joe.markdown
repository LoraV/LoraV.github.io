Today's prompt: "Write a scene that begins: 'Joe was the last person on Earth I expected to do that."

Joe was the last person on Earth you expected to do that.

Your co-worker Joe never really struck you as the open carry type. So seeing him head toward his car while holding a revolver piqued your curiosity.

"Hey Joe," you said. "Where you goin' with that gun in your hand?"

Joe didn't register that he'd even heard you. So you spoke up. "Hey Joe, I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand?"

He looks at you, a bit peeved. "I'm goin' down to shoot my old lady. You know I caught her messin' 'round with another man."

You look at him, dumbfounded. "What?"

"I'm goin' down to shoot my old lady. You know I caught her messin' 'round with another man."

"Uhhhh, that ain't too cool," you said. "You're serious? You're just going to kill her and damn the consequences?"

"What consequences? Ain't nobody can tie it back to me," he said.

"Joe, you literally just told me you were going to kill her."

He looks at you for about three whole seconds, and then realization creeps across his face.

"Oh, shit, witnesses!" he yells, then points the gun at you and pulls the trigger.
