Today's prompt: "An ethical dilemma"

There's a runaway trolley rushing down the tracks toward where five people are tied up. You are standing on a separate set of tracks to which the trolley could be diverted if I just pull this lever.

Of course I pull the lever. I'm saving five people, and we both know you have to die anyway.
