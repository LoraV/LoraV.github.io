Today's prompt: "Through a freak illness, you lose one of your senses. Which sense is it, what happens to you, and how do you deal with it?"

When Matt Murdock pushed a man out of the way of an oncoming truck carrying barrels of radioactive materials, the radioactive materials blinded him but heightened his other senses, leading him to become a superhero!

When you get COVID-19, your sense of smell disappears (and with it, your sense of taste), and you spend a significant amount of time with weakened lung capacity. No superpowers. Booooooo. But at least it's supposed to be temporary, and, more importantly, at least you survived.

Until the gas leak you could not detect.
