Today's prompt: "Describe your last visit to a doctor's office or hospital."

You're wheeled into the emergency room, blood gushing from a gut shot.

"Paging Dr. Guthrie," a nurse says into a speaker. "Paging Dr. Guthrie." A surgeon enters the room, pulling gloves onto his hands. 

"Okay, Nurse ... what was your name again?" the doctor says. 

"Barton," says the nurse, with an air of concern in her voice reserved for someone who has forgotten her name after having worked intimately with her for the last eight years and who is making her honestly wonder if body snatchers are a thing.

"Nurse Barton, of course, of course. Would you mind administering, oh, let's say 20 ccs of...." he trails off, then makes a kind of coughed verbalization that sounds like "coughdrugscough."

"Ummm, did you mean Ketamine?" Nurse Barton responds.

"Yeah. That. And hand me that thing that looks like an X-acto knife. What is that, the forceps?"
