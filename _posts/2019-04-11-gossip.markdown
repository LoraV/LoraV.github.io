Today's prompt: "Write a story that starts with a piece of gossip."

"Have you heard the latest?" Cindy asks you.

"I don't think so," you say. "What's up?"

"Cthulhu and Idh-yaa split up."

"No!" 

"Yeah."

"They always seemed like the perfect couple. Him with his tentacles and wings, and her with her giant pale worm form."

"Apparently she caught him cheating on her with Kassogtha."

"Whoa."

"Yeah, not cool. They have four kids."

"Isn't Kassogtha his sister?" you ask.

"I'm guessing when your whole deal is about being a cosmic evil entity who's coming to devour us all, you don't worry as much about sexual taboos," Cindy says.

"How's Idh-yaa taking it?"

"Not too good. She's been rampaging through cities and eating her feelings."

"Uhhh ... eating ... people?"

"Yeah, pretty much everyone she sees. Why?"

"Because that's her now," you say, as the massive gray-white worm turns down onto the street where you and Cindy are chatting.
