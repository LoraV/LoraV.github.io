Today's prompt: "Describe exultation"

You know how the NFL sometimes penalizes teams for excessive celebration after an end zone dance? Yeah, apparently Yog-Sothoth doesn't really mind its followers Ickey Shuffling and Funky Chickening and Hingle McCringleberrying all over the place. You should have seen the Chorazos Cult after they murdered you! Dabbing and Cabbage Patching and Popping and Locking and Moonwalking and Whipping and Nae Naeing and Dougieing and Running Manning. They got serious moves!
