Today's prompt: "Write down as many clichés and aphorisms as you can think of. Go back, and star the ones you actually say."

Pushing up daisies   
Sleep with the fishes   
Bite the dust   
Meet your maker   
Kick the bucket   
Rest in peace   
Bought the farm   
Taking a dirt nap   
Gave up the ghost   
Belly up   
Pop your clogs   
Six feet under   
The way of all flesh   
Went to the big farm in the sky   

Which ones do I say? About you, all of them.
