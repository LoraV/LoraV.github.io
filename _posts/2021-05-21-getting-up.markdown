Today's prompt: "A beginner's guide to getting up in the morning"

1. Hit snooze on your alarm as many or as few times as you like. This is a judgement-free zone.
2. When you're ready, maybe take a nice stretch.
3. Sit up.
4. Swing your legs down over the side of the bed. 
5. Stand up, and walk to the bathroom for a nice, hot shower.

This works about 99.999% of the time. That .001% of the time, though, when you hop out of bed and into a wormhole that spits you out into the vacuum of space, is a doozy.
