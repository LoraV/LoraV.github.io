Today's prompt: "The next sound you hear and what caused it"

Pop-pa-pa-pop-crack-crackle-cra-bash!

That is the sound a tree falling in the forest makes even when nobody's around to hear it. 

You're kind of an authority on this. Being a ghost that has haunted this forest ever since the Black Brotherhood kidnapped you, dragged you out here and ritually slaughtered you to please the Old Ones, you're about as close as you can get to being a nobody. I mean, you literally have no body. You watched the maggots and other insects devour it months ago. And it's not like you're really around, except in a metaphysical sense. But you still hear those trees.
