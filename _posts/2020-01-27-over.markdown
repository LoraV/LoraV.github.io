Today's prompt: "Write a single paragraph that conveys a lot about a character's life. Think about how this can be achieved with voice and rhythm and repetition."

You used to read every Teen Titans comic you could get your hands on. But now your obsession is over. You used to volunteer in a soup kitchen every year around the holidays. But now all your good deads are over. You used to tuck your hair behind your ear just so. Just so. But now every twitch and tic you made is over. The relationship you were re-establishing with your estranged brother? Over. The sweet tree fort you were in the middle of building for your kids? Over. It's all over. Thanks a lot, crevice that opened up in the earth and swallowed you whole.
