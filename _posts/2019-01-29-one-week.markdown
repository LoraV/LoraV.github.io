Today's prompt: "If you had one week to live..."

Oh man, if you had one week to live....

DisneyLand! No, DisneyWorld! Hell, Six Flags at the very least.

A solid week of lovemaking with your significant other.

Hmmm, are there any books you've always meant to read that you can definitely read in a week and still make time for everything else you want? Nah, screw that. Hedonism! Wine! Fancy restaurants!

Several hours petting your dog. Or, if you don't have one, someone else's dog.

And, toward the end, if you can endure it, a few phone calls to friends and family to tell them how much they mean to you.

Too bad you're not getting any of that. You're dying ... *now.*
