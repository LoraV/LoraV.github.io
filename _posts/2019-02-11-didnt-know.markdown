Today's prompt: "I didn't know what was happening at the time."

You honestly thought it was going to be a cheesy night of Ouija boards and tarot cards and everybody holding hands in a s√©ance while the so-called medium uses a parlor trick to bump the table. But with, like, cocktails. Kind of a grown-up version of playing "Bloody Mary."

So when the demon Astaroth appears in the summoning circle, you're already reaching inside the circle, where you left your margarita. That, unfortunately, leaves you vulnerable to being pulled into the circle and having your entire chest cavity ripped apart.

Now you're light as a feather, stiff as a board.
