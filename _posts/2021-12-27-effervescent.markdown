Today's prompt: "I have never felt this way before or since..."

The wizard casts his spell, and you experience a feeling you have never felt before and never will again. Your blood begins to vaporize. It's a strange feeling, all the molecules of your blood colliding with each other at a much faster rate than they ever have before, expanding and expanding. In moments, your capillaries will be unable to contain it, and you will die as your gaseous blood bursts from your body. But for now, you feel strangely giddy. Bubbly. A little fizzy.
