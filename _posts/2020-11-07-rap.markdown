Today's prompt: "Write the lyrics of a rap song. They must include a cop, a bad drug bust, and a dog."

Yo, you were sitting in your apartment bagging up weed   
When the cops bust in, guns raised, didn't read   
Your rights. You run out back like the bus in Speed   
And catch a bullet in the shoulder so you start to bleed.   

And right behind you is the K-9 unit.   
The dogs don't respect your rights either, to whit,  
They bite you right on your leg. You say, screw it,  
You're definitely in deep Shih Tzu shit.  

You kick away the dog but your calves he's tearing.   
The pain jolts through you and you start swearing.   
Your adrenaline's pumping but your muscles are wearing.   
And the cops are there and you know they ain't caring

If they take you dead, or take you alive.   
And then five more cop cars arrive.   
You raise up your hands because you want to survive    
But they shoot anyway 'cause they're in overdrive.
