Today's prompt: "Describe yourself in the third person--your physical appearance and personality--as though you were a character in a book." [Note -- I feel the second-person schtick is pretty integral to my format, so I'm just going to lean heavily into the description part.]

You're dead, to begin with. But that doesn't go far in the way of describing you. Let's try to give you a lens on yourself, let you see yourself how others really see you. Let's see. Uh, red, for a start. Very, very red. And kind of pulpy? Yeah. Mostly kind of a red mash, around the consistency of a cranberry chutney. Oh, sure, your bones are in there too, but even they aren't fully intact. Your mandible's a solid five feet away from the rest of your skull, and your femurs have been wrenched completely out of the pelvic girdle -- what's that? You don't want to see any more? I guess I can't blame you. Although it really is kind of a pretty shade of red.
