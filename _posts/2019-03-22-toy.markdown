Today's prompt: "The toy you most treasured"

AAAHHH-aahhh. AAAHHHH-aahhhh. AAAHHH-aahhh.

That's the sound your plastic robotic Cthulhu made as it marched one leg forward after the other.

CH-RONK. CH-RONK. CH-RONK.

That was the sound it made when it chomped down on the little plastic humans you fed to it.

You loved your robotic Cthulhu. Your parents tell stories about how when you were five, you insisted on bringing it with you when they took you to the mall. They had to wait for enough AAAHHH-aahhhs to pass for them to scoop you and plastic Cthulhu up so they could move on to Sears or J.C. Penney's.

When dread Cthulhu came, he didn't come with an AAAHHH-aahhh, AAAHHH-aahhh. He came with the sound of cities being crushed underfoot, of sheetrock shearing, of concrete crumbling. And when dread Cthulhu devoured you alive, it wasn't with a CH-RONK, CH-RONK. It was the sound of flesh rending beneath massive molars. Sort of a *squi-ritch*? Yeah, something like that.
