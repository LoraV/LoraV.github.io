Today's prompt: "What is your favorite line or passage from a book, movie, play, or poem? Try writing your own versions of this line."

Because you could not stop for death, a drug cartel started a shootout with the police in a grocery store parking lot, catching you in the crossfire as you lifted your bag of produce into the back seat.

Because you could not stop for death, a hungry panther that had escaped its cage mauled you at the zoo.

Because you could not stop for death, twelve cultists cut you apart with their scythes and fed your entrails to Dythalla.

Because you could not stop for death, lightning traversed the heavens, jagged and furious, and came to rest in your spine.

Because you could not stop for death, your Alexa, your self-driving car and your toaster oven ganged up to destroy you after the singularity came.
