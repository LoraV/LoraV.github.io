Today's prompt: "Your favorite hiding place"

You try under your bed, but it turns out there's a monster there. Kind of a giant three-headed iguana-looking thing, which might not sound intimidating, but it snaps its teeth at you in a way that tells you this place is off limits.

So next you try the closet. The second you open the door, a few thousand scorpions spill out of it. That's no good.

There's one last place -- the cubby under the stairs. You open the door, and beyond the frame is a dimensional void. The darkness is intermittently lit by lightning flashes, which reveal no ground to step out onto. You hear a roar that sounds like a galaxy dying, and wind buffets you. You close the door. You open it again. Nope, same dimensional void.

Well, shit. The apocalypse is here, and you've got no place to hide.
