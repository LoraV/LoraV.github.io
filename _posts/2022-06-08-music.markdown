“Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!” Bram Stoker's Dracula says of the wolves howling around his castle. It seems fitting in this world, too, where the Old One known as Alala is made of living sound, the Demon of Dissonance plagues the night, and Erich Zann becomes possessed while playing a manic tune on the viol. So if you're going to ask me whether it was foolish of you to allow yourself to be lured downstairs by a haunting refrain on the piano, the answer is yes, of course yes, a thousand times yes. Death comes for us all, and in your case, death is quite musical.
