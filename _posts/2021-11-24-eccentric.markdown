Today's prompt: "Describe an eccentric person in action"

Look, just because this particular cultist wears an oversized neon green top hat that would be the envy of Jamiroquai, puts plantains in everything he eats, and uses nunchucks as his weapon of choice, does not make him any less deadly than your classic black robe-wearing, ceremonial dagger-wielding cultist. Just because his fighting stance is more absurd than any in the stupidest action comedies you've ever seen, doesn't mean you won't be on the ground in an instant as his nunchucks first strike your hands, forcing you to drop your defensive weapon, and then your head, concussing you. Just because he's loudly singing "Happy" by Pharrell Williams does not mean you won't quickly expire as he cinches the nunchuck chains around your throat.
