Today's prompt: "Describe your mother."

Your mother was a real outdoorsy type. Her favorite meal was fresh-caught pan-fried trout, with s'mores for dessert. Her smile was inexhaustible when hiking a trail, pitching a tent or paddling a canoe. Her eyes were never brighter than when reflecting the glow of a campfire. She taught you everything you ever needed to know about dressing in layers and packing light.

Maybe if she were more into museums or badminton or something else a little more urban or suburban, you wouldn't have been devoured by bears at the age of 8.
