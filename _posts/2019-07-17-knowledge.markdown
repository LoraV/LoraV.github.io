Today's prompt: "Something more you'd like to know about"

You would have liked to know what it's like to breathe the cold, thin air of Everest. To know the sense of pride of finishing your first novel. To know what it's like to look into the eyes of your newborn grandchild.

You're never going to know any of those things, because until the jellylike mass re-formed around you, you didn't know that swords don't work on Ghisguth.
