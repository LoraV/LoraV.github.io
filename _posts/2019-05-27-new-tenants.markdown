Today's prompt: "The people who will live in your house after you move out"

Actually, your house sits on the market for a long time. It's not that it's not a nice place; you made some solid renovations to it -- better landscaping, a much more modern-looking kitchen. But most states do require real estate agents to disclose if a house has been the site of a violent death, since that can put a damper on home values. That effect on real estate prices goes double for ritual cult killings. 

The people who eventually move into your house are no-nonsense, skeptical types, not particularly given to superstition, but with a bit of a morbid streak. They know a good bargain when they see one, and they studied the M.O. of the Brotherhood of the Beast just enough prior to buying your house to satisfy themselves that they would be no more likely to be hacked into little bits than anyone else in your town. And they never decorate for Halloween. They don't have to.
