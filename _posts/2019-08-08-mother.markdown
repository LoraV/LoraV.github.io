Today's prompt: "How you're just like your mother"

Your mother had deep dimples and a melodic laugh. She made a great lasagna. She always wore her hair in a messy updo that got messier as the day progressed, and she always smelled a little like peanut butter. 

She's also dead. And in that respect, you are now just like her.
