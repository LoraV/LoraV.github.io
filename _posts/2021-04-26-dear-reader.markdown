Today's prompt: "Write a letter to the reader of a novel you haven't written yet."

Dear reader,

I'm really sorry you won't be finishing this novel. If my calculations are correct, you'll be dead before you finish page 46, assuming a reading speed of about 30 pages an hour. It's a real shame. I think you would have liked the twist ending. Plus all that great character work I did around the blind prophetess Wilhelmina -- you're never even going to meet her. That's not until page 81. Look, how about this? I'll go ahead and spoil the ending for you. Hermano the cat did it. Okay? Now go take about an hour to call your loved ones and get your affairs in order, and then if you have time, come back for about 12-16 pages of world-building. I promise, I put a lot of good bits in chapter one.
