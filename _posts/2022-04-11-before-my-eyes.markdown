Today's prompt: "The closest experience you've ever had to having your life flash before your eyes"

That time when you got a nosebleed and it didn't seem like it was ever going to stop.   
Watching Saturday morning cartoons with your siblings while eating Cocoa Puffs.   
That camping trip when you were toasting a marshmallow and it caught fire and you tried to wave the fire out but the marshmallow flew off your stick and landed on your brother's shoe.   
Saying goodbye to your first pet dog.   
That time when you actually made your free throws and it won the game.   
A bunch of other times when you missed your free throws.   
Your first kiss.   
Your first job, at a fast food place. For years afterward, you had nightmares about cleaning that place.   
Stressing out over college applications.   
Prom.   
Your first car crash.   
Your first time having sex.   
Countless hours writing fanfic.   
Countless hours playing video games.   
The first, fourth, and 27th dates of your first serious relationship.   
The first, seventh, and 34th dates of your current relationship.      
And tons and tons of dog walks, drinking beer, watching TV, reading, doing homework, doing work work, washing dishes, masturbating, changing light bulbs, mowing lawns, texting friends, commuting, buying groceries, and petting cats and dogs, all kind of interspersed in between.   

Yeah, so the closest I've ever been to having my life flash before my eyes is when I was standing right next to you when a memory wraith attacked and killed you and got your memory residue all over me.
