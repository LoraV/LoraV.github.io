Today's prompt: "Describe the biggest earthquake you've ever heard about"

The quake that hit your hometown was 6.7 on the Richter scale, but that wasn't what made it newsworthy. Sure, it toppled the steeple of the church four blocks from your house, and all of the shelves in the Albertsons fell over. Sure, the water main broke open at 14th and State and flooded several blocks. But that was nothing compared to the cause of the earthquake. That would have been Dhumin, the Burrower from the Bluff. You watched in shock as the massive Old One erupted from your back yard. It snaked its way though your house and into the street, devouring you and one of your dogs on the way, before terrorizing the rest of your neighborhood. I heard the National Guard got called. I'm pretty sure Dhumin would've made short work of them if he hadn't already eaten his fill by then and tunnelled back underground. Anyway. 6.7. That's really something.
