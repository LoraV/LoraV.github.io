Today's prompt: "Your most memorable experience in the back of a car"

Hnarqu, one of Cthulhu's little brothers, is described in Wikipedia as "a gigantic mouth surrounded by countless tentacles, similar to a titanic sea anemone."

Sure, yeah, you met your death in a back seat with him, but a makeout session with a mouth that big? Outstanding.
