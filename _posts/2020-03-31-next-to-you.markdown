Today's prompt: "A day in the life of the person sitting next to you"

It started out as a pretty normal day for Sam Fisher. He got up, put on his gym clothes, hit the treadmill, showered, put on his suit, took the bus in, ordered a bacon and egg sandwich and a black coffee from his favorite deli, and went to work. He answered emails, went to meetings, worked on next week's sales presentation. He eyed the burger on the lunch menu, but ordered the Cobb salad instead. He chatted with prospective clients. He sat on the bench to await his bus ride home.

Where his day got weird was when the person sitting next to him on the bench spontaneously combusted.
