Today's prompt: "Describe your favorite part of a man's body using only verbs." [I'm not going to focus on a single part of a man's body, but I will use primarily verbs when describing the viewpoint character's body throughout the scene.]

As if in slow motion: Flex. Bend. Extend. Then to the ground: Press. Push. Rebound. Then up again. Arch. Reach. Flex.

Run. 

Run. Run. Pound. Gasp. Glance. Run. Run. Run.

The sounds of timber cracking follow you. In front of you, the path is overgrown by a thicket of shrubs and young trees.

Push. Scramble. Scratch. Gasp. 

The sounds are closer now. An entire tree is ripped from the ground and thrust from the path of your pursuer.

Stumble. Rebalance. Sprint. Gasp. 

Beat. Throb. Beat. Throb.

The sounds of the creature in the forest are nearly deafening, and yet you can barely hear them over the sound of your own lungs fighting for air, your own heart thudding in your ears. 

Yellow eyes glow from a mass of black hair. Claws reach out and rake across your back.

Shriek. Stumble. Scream.
