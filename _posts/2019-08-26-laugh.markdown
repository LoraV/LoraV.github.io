Today's prompt: "What was the most recent incident in your life that made you laugh?"

The moment when the cultist plunged the fake knife into you. You roared with laughter and relief as he pulled the plastic blade away from your chest, then waggled his eyebrows as he pushed the knife tip into the hilt with his finger.

It was all very, very funny until he pulled out the actual knife.
