You call out to the others again. “You don't want to kill me! This is a mistake!” They maintain silence. The ropes that bind you do not slacken as they pull you closer and closer to the swamp. “Guys! This isn't funny! Stop!” you shout one last time. The fog parts, and you find yourself standing for a moment at the edge of the bank. You can smell the algae and slime that coats the water. You feel yourself being watched, as though by thousands of eyes. And then you see it – something trailing through the water. A kick sends you into the bog. A thousand eyes widen, then narrow. Something grabs your ankles, and you are pulled into the murky depths.
