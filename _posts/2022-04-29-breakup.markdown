Today's prompt: "Your first breakup"

"I think we should break up." 

Sam's words hung in the air like rapidly deflating balloons. The world seemed to slow down. Lockers swung slowly open. Classmates left blurry trails behind them as they walked past you through the halls.

"What? Why?" you choked out. 

"I just -- you know what, let's not make this harder than it is," Sam said. "We can talk more after school when there aren't as many people around." Fewer blurs were passing you now as students began to sense your emotional devastation and stopped to gawk. Finally, Sam turned and walked off to class.

You still remember that moment today. You remember how it felt like your world was ending.

Today, you feel that again, but a little more literally. You see, the world's gravitational pull has decided to break up with you. And as you are loosed into the atmosphere, freezing and unable to breathe, you wish you could think of some way to get the earth to take you back.
