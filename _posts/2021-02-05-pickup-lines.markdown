Today's prompt: "Ten bad bar pickup lines."

Feel free to use any of these the next time you go to a bar. It's going to be the last time you go to a bar, anyway:

1. Are you a time traveler? Because I see you in my future -- at the scene of my untimely death.
2. If being sexy was a crime, you'd be guilty as charged, along with the murder rap.
3. Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I keep walking by until I drop dead of exhaustion?
4. Are you a boxer? Because you're a knockout, causing fatal internal injuries.
5. Nice incendiary device. Wanna fuck?
6. Are you a master thief? Because you just stole my heart, and now I'm bleeding profusely from my chest cavity.
7. Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Did it hurt as much as this knife in my chest? 
8. I hope you know CPR, because you're taking my breath away, and I'm dying from lack of oxygen. 
9. I wasn't always religious, but I am now. You're the answer to all my prayers, and I'm ready to meet my Maker.
10. Are you a necromancer? Because baby, you're magical, and also, I'm dead.
