So autoerotic asphyxiation is a thing. Not my thing, but I'm not kink-shaming anybody here; I'm not going to yuck anybody's yums. Deaths from autoerotic asphyxiation are also a thing, but far less common than has sometimes been claimed; apparently 500-1000 deaths per year is a number that sometimes gets thrown around, but the number of people in the U.S. who die every year from it is probably less than 160. Your death from garroting, while similar in methodology, is way less sexy and way less voluntary.
