Today's prompt: "A moment of forgiveness"

You can't really blame someone for being hungry, can you? You can't blame them for needing sustenance? Some might see Cthulhu as a monster, but is that really the totality of the picture?

Okay yes he's really a monster with giant stature and bat wings and mouth tentacles, but his need to devour you is at least forgiveable, right?
