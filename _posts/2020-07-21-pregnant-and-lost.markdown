Today's prompt: "Pregnant and lost"

Even when you're giving birth to a normal human baby, it's probably best to do it in a hospital or with a doula, not in the middle of the woods. I really, really wouldn't recommend that locale when you're giving birth to the Antichrist. But hey, what do I know. You do you.
