"You'd have a hard time being eloquent, too, if you'd just had your entire mind wiped," is what you would have said, had your entire mind not just been wiped by the device he's strapped to your cranium. But your higher language functions are long gone, along with your self-awareness, and pretty soon, your brain won't even be able to handle respiration.
