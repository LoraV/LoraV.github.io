Today's prompt: "You're the high school sweetheart from the above (Aug. 22) prompt. Write your reply to the breakup note."

Dear Taylor,

If you're receiving this letter, it's because I've been killed in combat. A ballistic missile to the base, maybe, or my vehicle triggering an IED while I was out on rounds. Or maybe the food here just sucked so much that I gave up the ghost. I can only imagine why I've died. My friend Matt promised he would send you this letter if I died, unless he dies at the same time, in which case Aaron in the 124th has a copy.

I hope you never read this letter. I hope we get to get married when I go home. But if you are reading this, just know that I never stopped loving you. I hope you find someone else who'll treat you right, and I hope you have a good, long life.

Much love,

[Your name]
