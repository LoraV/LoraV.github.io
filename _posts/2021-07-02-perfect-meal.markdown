Today's prompt: "A perfect meal"

Hmmm. I'm thinking a rack of lamb marinated with rosemary, thyme and garlic, served with some sauteed mushrooms and maybe some steamed green beans or a fennel gratin or roasted potatoes. But that's just me.

If it's Cthulhu, he's probably going to pick fresh-caught you, slathered in a vinegar-based sauce and flame-broiled, and served with a loaded baked potato.
