Today's prompt: "Who people think you are, compared to who you know you are"

Most people think you've been dead for months. Your body was never recovered, but there've been so many mass graves of charred remains uncovered over the last year that they can be forgiven for jumping to conclusions. And you were very clever. You saw all the signs of the cultists gathering, growing in power and influence, and summoning the Great Old Ones to this plane. And what did you do? You stocked up on bottled water and canned goods. You built your bunker in secret. And when the Twin Blasphemies, Nug and Yeb, destroyed most of your city, you took the opportunity to disappear.

No one knows you're alive except you, and the random cultist who happened to hear the sounds of your generator as he wandered through the woods, hoping against hope to find a new sacrifice, and who is now standing over your sleeping form, knife raised.
